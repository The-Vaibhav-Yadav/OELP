      "explanation": "Let's assume the number of male participants in team P and team R are 'p' and 'r' respectively, and the number of female participants in team P and team R are 'q' and 't' respectively. Given that the total number of participants is 90, we can write the equation: 9 + 11 + p + q + r + t = 90, which simplifies to p + q + r + t = 61. We are also given that the number of female participants from team P and team R is 4 and 5 respectively, and the number of male participants from team P and team R is 6 and 7 respectively. Therefore, p + 6 = 61 - q - 5 - t, which simplifies to p = 50 - q - t. Similarly, r + 7 = 61 - t - q, which simplifies to r = 54 - q - t. Since the number of participants from team S is 9, and team S has only male participants, we know that there are 9 male participants from team S. Therefore, the total number of male participants from teams P, R, and S is 50 + 54 = 104. However, we know that the total number of participants is 90, and the number of female participants from team P and team R is 4 and 5 respectively. Therefore, the total number of female participants from teams P, R, and S is 4 + 5 + 9 = 18. This means that the number of female participants from team T must be 90 - 104 - 18 = -32, which is not possible. Therefore, neither statement is true.",

However, this is not among the options. But we can find the number of students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta and then subtract this from the total number of students. Number of students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta = Total students - (students who preferred Pizza) - (students who preferred Pasta) + (students who preferred both) = 100 - 60 - 20 + 10 = 30. Therefore, the number of students who preferred Pizza or Pasta = Total students - (students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta) = 100 - 30 = 70. However, this is also not among the options. The correct answer is actually the total number of students minus the number of students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta, and then subtracting the number of students who preferred neither from the total number of students, we get the number of students who preferred Pizza or Pasta. But the given options are all wrong. We need to go with the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Total students who preferred Pizza or Pasta = (students who preferred Pizza) + (students who preferred Pasta) - (students who preferred both) = 60 + 20 - 10 = 70. But we can find the number of students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta and then subtract this from the total number of students. Number of students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta = Total students - (students who preferred Pizza) - (students who preferred Pasta) + (students who preferred both) = 100 - 60 - 20 + 10 = 30. Therefore, the number of students who preferred Pizza or Pasta = Total students - (students who preferred neither Pizza nor Pasta) = 100 - 30 = 70. However, this is also not among the options.

Then, (3x + 3x) / 2 = 25 * 15. Similarly, (x + x) / 2 = 25 * (15 - 2). Simplifying the equations, we get 3x = 375 and x = 100.

The actual number of employees in the two largest branches will be 3x * 2 = 600 * 2 = 1200, but the question is asking for the total number of employees in two largest branches and the average of two largest branches is 3x = 375 * 2 = 750.

Substituting this value of b in the first equation, we get 2a - 3(2c - 1) + 4c = 16. Simplifying this equation, we get 2a - 6c + 3 + 4c = 16, which reduces to 2a - 2c = 13. Now, we can express a in terms of c as a = 13/2 + c. Substituting this value of a in the expression a - 2b, we get (13/2 + c) - 2(2c - 1) = 13/2 + c - 4c + 2 = -3c + 15/2. Now, substituting b = 2c - 1 in the expression a - 2b, we get a - 2(2c - 1) = a - 4c + 2. Simplifying this expression further, we get 2a - 4c + 2 = 2(a - 2c) + 2 = 2(13/2 + c - 2c) + 2 = 2(-3/2) + 2 = -3 + 2 = -1. Now, we can solve for c by using the equation b - 2c = -1. Substituting b = 2c - 1 in this equation, we get 2c - 1 - 2c = -1, which reduces to -1 = -1. This equation is true for any value of c. However, we can see that a - 2b = -1 if c = 3. Substituting c = 3 in the expression a - 2b, we get a - 2b = 13/2 + 3 - 2(2*3 - 1) = 13/2 + 3 - 10 = -3/2 + 3 = 3/2.",

The longer chord is twice as long as the first, so the distance of the longer chord from the centre is twice that of the first chord, i.e., 8 cm. Therefore, the area of the sector is half the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the chord and the radii, i.e., (22/7) * 4 * 4 - (1/2) * 8 * 4 = 24\u03c0 - 16 = 30\u03c0 cm\u00b2.",

Also, if Mishra does 40% more of his usual work, and Kumar does 20% less of his usual work, their combined rate becomes M + 1.4M - 0.2K = 1.8M - 0.2K. Since this rate is equal to 1/30, we can say that 1.8M - 0.2K = 1/30. Solving these two equations, we get K = 1/45, which means Kumar takes 45 days to complete the job alone.

Substituting the given values, we get 64 - 18 = 20 - 2(ab + ac + bc), which simplifies to 46 = 20 - 2(ab + ac + bc). We can then find the value of (ab + ac + bc), which turns out to be -13.

If the average height of all the students is 168 cm, then the average height of the students who are shorter than 165 cm is",

      "explanation": "Let's denote the sum of heights of all 35 students as S and the sum of heights of students shorter than 165 cm as s. Then, S = 35 * 168. The sum of heights of students taller than 180 cm is 5 * 185 and the sum of heights of students between 165 cm and 180 cm is 8 * 172.5. So, s = S - (5 * 185 + 8 * 172.5) = 5880 - (925 + 1370) = 5880 - 2295 = 3585. Now, the average height of the students shorter than 165 cm is s/30 = 3585/30 = 119.5.
