All that we think we know about how life hangs together is really some kind of illusion that we have  perpetrated on ourselves because of our limited vision. What appear to be inanimate objects such as stones  turn out not only to be alive in the same way that we are, but also in many infinitesimal ways to be affected  by stimuli just as humans are. The distinction between animate and inanimate simply cannot be made when  you enter the world of quantum mechanics and try to determine how those apparent subatomic particles, of  which you and everything else in our universe is composed, are all tied together. The point is that physics and  metaphysics show there is a pattern to the universe that goes beyond our capacity to grasp it with our  brains.",
    "option1": "The inanimate world is both sentient and cognizant like its animate counterpart.",
    "option2": "The effect of stimuli is similar in inanimate objects when compared to animate objects or living beings.",
    "option3": "Quantum physics indicates that an astigmatic view of reality results in erroneous assumptions about the  universe.",
    "option4": "Arbitrary distinctions between inanimate and animate objects disappear at the scale at which quantum  mechanics works."

    "question_text": "The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries. Choose the option that best captures the  essence of the passage.  It’s not that modern historians of medieval Africa have been ignorant about contacts between Ethiopia and  Europe; they just had the power dynamic reversed. The traditional narrative stressed Ethiopia as weak and in  trouble in the face of aggression from external forces, so Ethiopia sought military assistance from their fellow  Christians to the north. But the real story, buried in plain sight in medieval diplomatic texts, simply had not  yet been put together by modern scholars. Recent research pushes scholars of medieval Europe to imagine a  much more richly connected medieval world: at the beginning of the so-called Age of Exploration, there is  evidence that the kings of Ethiopia were sponsoring their own missions of diplomacy, faith and commerce.",
    "option1": "Medieval historical sources selectively promoted the narrative that powerful European forces were called  on to protect weak African civilisations such as Ethiopia, but this is far from reality.",
    "option2": "Historians were under the illusion that Ethiopia needed military protection from their neighbours, but in  fact the country had close commercial and religious connections with them.",
    "option3": "Medieval texts have documented how strong connections between the Christian communities of Ethiopia  and Europe were invaluable in establishing military and trade links between the two civilisations.",
    "option4": "Medieval texts have been ‘cherry-picked’ to promote a view of Ethiopia as weak and in need of Europe’s  https://bodheeprep.com    CAT 2022 Question Paper (Slot 1)  military help with aggressive neighbours, but recent studies reveal it was a well-connected and outward- looking culture."

Fish skin collagen has excellent thermo-stability and tensile strength making it ideal for use as bandage  that adheres to the skin and adjusts to body movements.  2. Collagen, one of the main structural proteins in connective tissues in the human body, is well known for  promoting skin regeneration.  3. Fish skin swims in here as diseases and bacteria that affect fish are different from most human pathogens.  4. The risk of introducing disease agents into other species through the use of pig and cow collagen proteins  for wound healing has inhibited its broader applications in the medical field."

    "question_text": "The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries. Choose the option that best captures the  essence of the passage.  Petitioning is an expeditious democratic tradition, used frequently in prior centuries, by which citizens can  bring issues directly to governments. As expressions of collective voice, they support procedural democracy  by shaping agendas. They can also recruit citizens to causes, give voice to the voteless, and apply the  discipline of rhetorical argument that clarifies a point of view. By contrast, elections are limited in several  respects: they involve only a few candidates, and thus fall far short of a representative democracy. Further,  voters’ choices are not specific to particular policies or laws, and elections are episodic, whereas the voice of  the people needs to be heard and integrated constantly into democratic government.",
    "option1": "By giving citizens greater control over shaping political and democratic agendas, political petitions are  invaluable as they represent an ideal form of a representative democracy.",
    "option2": "Petitioning has been important to democratic functioning, as it supplements the electoral process by  enabling ongoing engagement with the government.",
    "option3": "Petitioning is definitely more representative of the collective voice, and the functioning of democratic  government could improve if we relied more on petitioning rather than holding periodic elections.",
    "option4": "Citizens become less inclined to petitioning as it enables vocal citizens to shape political agendas, but this  needs to change to strengthen democracies today."

In that era, perfectionism meant seamlessly conforming to values,  behaviour and appearance: chiselled confidence for men, demure graciousness for women.

In that era, perfectionism meant seamlessly conforming to values,  behaviour and appearance: chiselled confidence for men, demure graciousness for women.
