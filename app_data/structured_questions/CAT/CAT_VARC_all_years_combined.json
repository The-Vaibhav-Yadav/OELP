Choose the best answer to each question.  The Chinese have two different concepts of a copy. Fangzhipin . . . are imitations where the difference from  the original is obvious. These are small models or copies that can be purchased in a museum shop, for  example. The second concept for a copy is fuzhipin . . . They are exact reproductions of the original, which,  for the Chinese, are of equal value to the original. It has absolutely no negative connotations. The  discrepancy with regard to the understanding of what a copy is has often led to misunderstandings and  arguments between China and Western museums. The Chinese often send copies abroad instead of originals,  in the firm belief that they are not essentially different from the originals. The rejection that then comes  from the Western museums is perceived by the Chinese as an insult. . . .  The Far Eastern notion of identity is also very confusing to the Western observer. The Ise Grand Shrine [in  Japan] is 1,300 years old for the millions of Japanese people who go there on pilgrimage every year. But in  reality this temple complex is completely rebuilt from scratch every 20 years. . . .  The cathedral of Freiburg Minster in southwest Germany is covered in scaffolding almost all year round. The  sandstone from which it is built is a very soft, porous material that does not withstand natural erosion by rain  and wind. After a while, it crumbles. As a result, the cathedral is continually being examined for damage, and  eroded stones are replaced. And in the cathedral’s dedicated workshop, copies of the damaged sandstone  figures are constantly being produced. Of course, attempts are made to preserve the stones from the Middle  Ages for as long as possible. But at some point they, too, are removed and replaced with new stones.  Fundamentally, this is the same operation as with the Japanese shrine, except in this case the production of a  replica takes place very slowly and over long periods of time. . . . In the field of art as well, the idea of an  unassailable original developed historically in the Western world. Back in the 17th century [in the West],  excavated artworks from antiquity were treated quite differently from today. They were not restored in a  way that was faithful to the original. Instead, there was massive intervention in these works, changing their  appearance. . . .  It is probably this intellectual position that explains why Asians have far fewer scruples about cloning than  Europeans. The South Korean cloning researcher Hwang Woo-suk, who attracted worldwide attention with  his cloning experiments in 2004, is a Buddhist. He found a great deal of support and followers among  Buddhists, while Christians called for a ban on human cloning. . . . Hwang legitimised his cloning experiments  with his religious affiliation: ‘I am Buddhist, and I have no philosophical problem with cloning. And as you  know, the basis of Buddhism is that life is recycled through reincarnation. In some ways, I think, therapeutic  cloning restarts the circle of life.’"

Choose the best answer to each question.  Critical theory of technology is a political theory of modernity with a normative dimension. It belongs to a  tradition extending from Marx to Foucault and Habermas according to which advances in the formal claims  of human rights take center stage while in the background centralization of ever more powerful public  institutions and private organizations imposes an authoritarian social order.  Marx attributed this trajectory to the capitalist rationalization of production. Today it marks many  https://bodheeprep.com    CAT 2022 Question Paper (Slot 1)  institutions besides the factory and every modern political system, including so-called socialist systems. This  trajectory arose from the problems of command over a disempowered and deskilled labor force; but  everywhere [that] masses are organized – whether it be Foucault’s prisons or Habermas’s public sphere – the  same pattern prevails. Technological design and development is shaped by this pattern as the material base  of a distinctive social order. Marcuse would later point to a “project” as the basis of what he called rather  confusingly “technological rationality.” Releasing technology from this project is a democratic political task.  In accordance with this general line of thought, critical theory of technology regards technologies as an  environment rather than as a collection of tools. We live today with and even within technologies that  determine our way of life. Along with the constant pressures to build centers of power, many other social  values and meanings are inscribed in technological design. A hermeneutics of technology must make explicit  the meanings implicit in the devices we use and the rituals they script. Social histories of technologies such as  the bicycle, artificial lighting or firearms have made important contributions to this type of analysis. Critical  theory of technology attempts to build a methodological approach on the lessons of these histories.  As an environment, technologies shape their inhabitants. In this respect, they are comparable to laws and  customs. Each of these institutions can be said to represent those who live under their sway through  privileging certain dimensions of their human nature. Laws of property represent the interest in ownership  and control. Customs such as parental authority represent the interest of childhood in safety and growth.  Similarly, the automobile represents its users in so far as they are interested in mobility. Interests such as  these constitute the version of human nature sanctioned by society.  This notion of representation does not imply an eternal human nature. The concept of nature as non-identity  in the Frankfurt School suggests an alternative. On these terms, nature is what lies at the limit of history, at  the point at which society loses the capacity to imprint its meanings on things and control them effectively.  The reference here is, of course, not to the nature of natural science, but to the lived nature in which we find  ourselves and which we are. This nature reveals itself as that which cannot be totally encompassed by the  machinery of society. For the Frankfurt School, human nature, in all its transcending force, emerges out of a  historical context as that context is [depicted] in illicit joys, struggles and pathologies. We can perhaps admit  a less romantic . . . conception in which those dimensions of human nature recognized by society are also  granted theoretical legitimacy."

Choose the best answer to each question.  Stoicism was founded in 300 BC by the Greek philosopher Zeno and survived into the Roman era until about  AD 300. According to the Stoics, emotions consist of two movements. The first movement is the immediate  feeling and other reactions (e.g., physiological response) that occur when a stimulus or event occurs. For  instance, consider what could have happened if an army general accused Marcus Aurelius of treason in front  of other officers. The first movement for Marcus may have been (internal) surprise and anger in response to  this insult, accompanied perhaps by some involuntary physiological and expressive responses such as face  flushing and a movement of the eyebrows. The second movement is what one does next about the emotion.  Second movement behaviors occur after thinking and are under one’s control. Examples of second  https://bodheeprep.com    CAT 2022 Question Paper (Slot 1)  movements for Marcus might have included a plot to seek revenge, actions signifying deference and  appeasement, or perhaps proceeding as he would have proceeded whether or not this event occurred:  continuing to lead the Romans in a way that Marcus Aurelius believed best benefited them. In the Stoic view,  choosing a reasoned, unemotional response as the second movement is the only appropriate response.  The Stoics believed that to live the good life and be a good person, we need to free ourselves of nearly all  desires such as too much desire for money, power, or sexual gratification. Prior to second movements, we  can consider what is important in life. Money, power, and excessive sexual gratification are not important.  Character, rationality, and kindness are important. The Epicureans, first associated with the Greek  philosopher Epicurus . . . held a similar view, believing that people should enjoy simple pleasures, such as  good conversation, friendship, food, and wine, but not be indulgent in these pursuits and not follow passion  for those things that hold no real value like power and money. As Oatley (2004) states, “the Epicureans  articulated a view—enjoyment of relationship with friends, of things that are real rather than illusory, simple  rather than artificially inflated, possible rather than vanishingly unlikely—that is certainly relevant today” . . .  In sum, these ancient Greek and Roman philosophers saw emotions, especially strong ones, as potentially  dangerous. They viewed emotions as experiences that needed to be [reined] in and controlled.  As Oatley (2004) points out, the Stoic idea bears some similarity to Buddhism. Buddha, living in India in the  6th century BC, argued for cultivating a certain attitude that decreases the probability of (in Stoic terms)  destructive second movements. Through meditation and the right attitude, one allows emotions to happen  to oneself (it is impossible to prevent this), but one is advised to observe the emotions without necessarily  acting on them; one achieves some distance and decides what has value and what does not have value.  Additionally, the Stoic idea of developing virtue in oneself, of becoming a good person, which the Stoics  believed we could do because we have a touch of the divine, laid the foundation for the three monotheistic  religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam . . . As with Stoicism, tenets of these religions include controlling  our emotions lest we engage in sinful behavior."

    "option4": "A bald statement is one that requires no qualifications to infer its meaning.  The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to  each question.  [Octopuses are] misfits in their own extended families ... They belong to the Mollusca  class Cephalopoda. But they don't look like their cousins at all. Other molluscs include  sea snails, sea slugs, bivalves - most are shelled invertebrates with a dorsal foot.  Cephalopods are all arms, and can be as tiny as 1 centimetre and as large at 30 feet.  Some of them have brains the size of a walnut, which is large for an invertebrate. . . .  It makes sense for these molluscs to have added protection in the form of a higher  cognition; they don't have a shell covering them, and pretty much everything feeds on  cephalopods, including humans. But how did cephalopods manage to secure their own  invisibility cloak?  Cephalopods fire from multiple cylinders to achieve this in varying degrees from species  to species. There are four main catalysts - chromatophores, iridophores, papillae and  leucophores....  [Chromatophores] are organs on their bodies that contain pigment sacs, which have red,  yellow and brown pigment granules. These sacs have a network of radial muscles,  meaning muscles arranged in a circle radiating outwards. These are connected to the  brain by a nerve. When the cephalopod wants to change colour, the brain carries an  electrical impulse through the nerve to the muscles that expand outwards, pulling open  the sacs to display the colours on the skin. Why these three colours? Because these are  the colours the light reflects at the depths they live in (the rest is absorbed before it  reaches those depths). . . . Well, what about other colours? Cue the iridophores. Think  of a second level of skin that has thin stacks of cells. These can reflect light back at  different wavelengths. . . It's using the same properties that we've seen in hologram  stickers, or rainbows on puddles of oil. You move your head and you see a different  colour. The sticker isn't doing anything but reflecting light - it's your movement that's  changing the appearance of the colour. This property of holograms, oil and other such  surfaces is called \"iridescence\". . . .  Papillae are sections of the skin that can be deformed to make a texture bumpy. Even  humans possess them (goosebumps) but cannot use them in the manner that  cephalopods can. For instance, the use of these cells is how an octopus can wrap itself      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    over a rock and appear jagged or how a squid or cuttlefish can imitate the look of a coral  reef by growing miniature towers on its skin. It actually matches the texture of the  substrate it chooses. Finally, the leucophores: According to a paper, published in Nature,  cuttlefish and octopuses possess an additional type of reflector cell called a leucophore.  They are cells that scatter full spectrum light so that they appear white in a similar way  that a polar bear's fur appears white. Leucophores will also reflect any filtered light  shown on them . . If the water appears blue at a certain depth, the octopuses and  cuttlefish can appear blue; if the water appears green, they appear green, and so on and  so forth."

Choose the best answer to  each https://bodheeprep.com/  We begin with the emergence of the philosophy of the social sciences as an arena of  thought and as a set of social institutions. The two characterisations overlap but are not  congruent. Academic disciplines are social institutions. . . My view is that institutions are  all those social entities that organise action: they link acting individuals into social  structures. There are various kinds of institutions. Hegelians and Marxists emphasise  universal institutions such as the family, rituals, governance, economy and the military.  These are mostly institutions that just grew. Perhaps in some imaginary beginning of  time they spontaneously appeared. In their present incarnations, however, they are  very much the product of conscious attempts to mould and plan them. We have family  law, established and disestablished churches, constitutions and laws, including those  governing the economy and the military. Institutions deriving from statute, like joint- stock companies are formal by contrast with informal ones such as friendships. There  are some institutions that come in both informal and formal variants, as well as in mixed  ones. Consider the fact that the stock exchange and the black market are both market  institutions, one formal one not. Consider further that there are many features of the  work of the stock exchange that rely on informal, noncodifiable agreements, not least  the language used for communication. To be precise, mixtures are the norm . . . From  constitutions at the top to by-laws near the bottom we are always adding to, or  tinkering with, earlier institutions, the grown and the designed are intertwined. It is  usual in social thought to treat culture and tradition as different from, although  alongside, institutions. The view taken here is different. Culture and tradition are sub- sets of institutions analytically isolated for explanatory or expository purposes. Some  social scientists have taken all institutions, even purely local ones, to be entities that  satisfy basic human needs - under local conditions . . . Others differed and declared any  structure of reciprocal roles and norms an institution. Most of these differences are  differences of emphasis rather than disagreements. Let us straddle all these versions  and present institutions very generally . . . as structures that serve to coordinate the  actions of individuals. . . . Institutions themselves then have no aims or purpose other  than those given to them by actors or used by actors to explain them . . .  Language is the formative institution for social life and for science . . . Both formal and  informal language is involved, naturally grown or designed. (Language is all of these to  varying degrees.) Languages are paradigms of institutions or, from another perspective,      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    nested sets of institutions. Syntax, semantics, lexicon and alphabet/character-set are all  institutions within the larger institutional framework of a written language. Natural  languages are typical examples of what Ferguson called 'the result of human action, but  not the execution of any human design'[;] reformed natural languages and artificial  languages introduce design into their modifications or refinements of natural language.  Above all, languages are paradigms of institutional tools that function to coordinate."

When we teach engineering problems now, we ask students to come to a single \"best\"  solution defined by technical ideals like low cost, speed to build, and ability to scale. This  way of teaching primes students to believe that their decision-making is purely  objective, as it is grounded in math and science. This is known as technical-social  dualism, the idea that the technical and social dimensions of engineering problems are  readily separable and remain distinct throughout the problem-definition and solution  process.  Nontechnical parameters such as access to a technology, cultural relevancy or potential  harms are deemed political and invalid in this way of learning. But those technical ideals  are at their core social and political choices determined by a dominant culture focused  on economic growth for the most privileged segments of society. By choosing to  downplay public welfare as a critical parameter for engineering design, we risk creating  a culture of disengagement from societal concerns amongst engineers that is  antithetical to the ethical code of engineering.  In my field of medical devices, ignoring social dimensions has real consequences. . . .  Most FDA-approved drugs are incorrectly dosed for people assigned female at birth,  leading to unexpected adverse reactions. This is because they have been inadequately  represented in  Beyond physical failings, subjective beliefs treated as facts by those in decision-making  roles can encode social inequities. For example, spirometers, routinely used devices that  measure lung capacity, still have correction factors that automatically assume smaller  lung capacity in Black and Asian individuals. These racially based adjustments are  derived from research done by eugenicists who thought these racial differences were  biologically determined and who considered nonwhite people as inferior. These  machines ignore the influence of social and environmental factors on lung capacity.  Many technologies for systemically marginalized people have not been built because  they were not deemed important such as better early diagnostics and treatment for  diseases like endometriosis, a disease that afflicts 10 percent of people with uteruses.  And we hardly question whether devices are built sustainably, which has led to a crisis  of medical waste and health care accounting for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas  emissions.      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    Social justice must be made core to the way engineers are trained. Some universities are  working on this. . . . Engineers taught this way will be prepared to think critically about  what problems we choose to solve, how we do so responsibly and how we build teams  that challenge our ways of thinking.  Individual engineering professors are also working to embed societal needs in their  pedagogy. Darshan Karwat at the University of Arizona developed activist engineering to  challenge engineers to acknowledge their full moral and social responsibility through  practical selfreflection. Khalid Kadir at the University of California, Berkeley, created the  popular course Engineering, Environment, and Society that teaches engineers how to  engage in place-based knowledge, an understanding of the people, context and history,  to design better technical approaches in collaboration with communities. When we  design and build with equity and justice in mind, we craft better solutions that respond  to the complexities of entrenched systemic problems."

Choose the best answer to  each question.  Interpretations of the Indian past . . . were inevitably influenced by colonial concerns  and interests, and also by prevalent European ideas about history, civilization and the  Orient. Orientalist scholars studied the languages and the texts with selected Indian  scholars, but made little attempt to understand the world-view of those who were  teaching them. The readings therefore are something of a disjuncture from the  traditional ways of looking at the Indian past. . . .  Orientalism [which we can understand broadly as Western perceptions of the Orient]  fuelled the fantasy and the freedom sought by European Romanticism, particularly in its  opposition to the more disciplined Neo-Classicism. The cultures of Asia were seen as  bringing a new Romantic paradigm. Another Renaissance was anticipated through an  acquaintance with the Orient, and this, it was thought, would be different from the  earlier Greek Renaissance. It was believed that this Oriental Renaissance would liberate  European thought and literature from the increasing focus on discipline and rationality      that had followed from the earlier Enlightenment. . . [The Romantic English poets,  Wordsworth and Coleridge,] were apprehensive of the changes introduced by  industrialization and turned to nature and to fantasies of the Orient.  However, this enthusiasm gradually changed, to conform with the emphasis later in the  nineteenth century on the innate superiority of European civilization. Oriental  civilizations were now seen as having once been great but currently in decline. The  various phases of Orientalism tended to mould European understanding of the Indian  past into a particular pattern. . . . There was an attempt to formulate Indian culture as  uniform, such formulations being derived from texts that were given priority. The so- called 'discovery' of India was largely through selected literature in Sanskrit. This  interpretation tended to emphasize nonhistorical aspects of Indian culture, for example  the idea of an unchanging continuity of society and religion over 3,000 years; and it was  believed that the Indian pattern of life was so concerned with metaphysics and the  subtleties of religious belief that little attention was given to the more tangible aspects.  German Romanticism endorsed this image of India, and it became the mystic land for  many Europeans, where even the most ordinary actions were imbued with a complex  symbolism. This was the genesis of the idea of the spiritual east, and also, incidentally,  the refuge of European intellectuals seeking to distance themselves from the changing  patterns of their own societies. A dichotomy in values was maintained, Indian values  being described as 'spiritual' and European values as 'materialistic', with little attempt to  juxtapose these values with the reality of Indian society. This theme has been even  more firmly endorsed by a section of Indian opinion during the last hundred years.  It was a consolation to the Indian intelligentsia for its perceived inability to counter the  technical superiority of the west, a superiority viewed as having enabled Europe to  colonize Asia and other parts of the world. At the height of anti-colonial nationalism it  acted as a salve for having been made a colony of Britain."

Choose the best answer to  each question.  As software improves, the people using it become less likely to sharpen their own know- how. Applications that offer lots of prompts and tips are often to blame; simpler, less  solicitous programs push people harder to think, act and learn.      Ten years ago, information scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands had a  group of people carry out complicated analytical and planning tasks using either  rudimentary software that provided no assistance or sophisticated software that offered  a great deal of aid. The researchers found that the people using the simple software  developed better strategies, made fewer mistakes and developed a deeper aptitude for  the work. The people using the more advanced software, meanwhile, would often  \"aimlessly click around\" when confronted with a tricky problem. The supposedly helpful  software actually short-circuited their thinking and learning.  [According to] philosopher Hubert Dreyfus . . . . our skills get sharper only through  practice, when we use them regularly to overcome different sorts of difficult challenges.  The goal of  modern software, by contrast, is to ease our way through such challenges. Arduous,  painstaking work is exactly what programmers are most eager to automate-after all,  that is where the immediate efficiency gains tend to lie. In other words, a fundamental  tension ripples between the interests of the people doing the automation and the  interests of the people doing the work.  Nevertheless, automation's scope continues to widen. With the rise of electronic health  records, physicians increasingly rely on software templates to guide them through  patient exams. The programs incorporate valuable checklists and alerts, but they also  make medicine more routinized and formulaic—and distance doctors from their  patients . . . Harvard Medical School professor Beth Lown, in a 2012 journal article . . .  warned that when doctors become \"screen-driven,\" following a computer's prompts  rather than \"the patient's narrative thread,\" their thinking can become constricted. In  the worst cases, they may miss important diagnostic signals. . . .  In a recent paper published in the journal Diagnosis, three medical researchers . . .  examined the misdiagnosis of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the  U.S., at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. They argue that the digital templates  used by the hospital's clinicians to record patient information probably helped to induce  a kind of tunnel vision. \"These highly constrained tools,\" the researchers write, \"are  optimized for data capture but at the expense of sacrificing their utility for appropriate  triage and diagnosis, leading users to miss the forest for the trees.\" Medical software,  they write, is no \"replacement for basic history-taking, examination skills, and critical  thinking.\" . . . There is an alternative. In \"human-centered automation,\" the talents of  people take precedence . . . . In this model, software plays an essential but secondary  role. It takes over routine functions that a human operator has already mastered, issues  alerts when unexpected situations arise, provides fresh information that expands the  operator's perspective and counters the biases that often distort human thinking. The  technology becomes the expert's partner, not the expert's replacement."

Nature has all along yielded her flesh to humans. First, we took nature's materials as  food, fibers, and shelter. Then we learned to extract raw materials from her biosphere  to create our own new synthetic materials. Now Bios is yielding us her mind-we are  taking her logic. Clockwork logic-the logic of the machines-will only build simple  contraptions. Truly complex systems such as a cell, a meadow, an economy, or a brain  (natural or artificial) require a rigorous nontechnological logic. We now see that no logic  except bio-logic can assemble a thinking device, or even a workable system of any  magnitude.  It is an astounding discovery that one can extract the logic of Bios out of biology and  have something useful. Although many philosophers in the past have suspected one  could abstract the laws of life and apply them elsewhere, it wasn't until the complexity  of computers and human-made systems became as complicated as living things, that it  was possible to prove this. It's eerie how much of life can be transferred. So far, some of  the traits of the living that have successfully been transported to mechanical systems  are: self-replication, selfgovernance, limited self-repair, mild evolution, and partial  learning.  We have reason to believe yet more can be synthesized and made into something new.  Yet at the same time that the logic of Bios is being imported into machines, the logic of  Technos is being imported into life. The root of bioengineering is the desire to control  the organic long enough to improve it. Domesticated plants and animals are examples of  technos-logic applied to life. The wild aromatic root of the Queen Anne's lace weed has  been fine-tuned over generations by selective herb gatherers until it has evolved into a  sweet carrot of the garden; the udders of wild bovines have been selectively enlarged in  a \"unnatural\" way to satisfy humans rather than calves. Milk cows and carrots,  therefore, are human inventions as much as steam engines and gunpowder are. But  milk cows and carrots are more indicative of the kind of inventions humans will make in  the future: products that are grown rather than manufactured.      Genetic engineering is precisely what cattle breeders do when they select better strains  of Holsteins, only bioengineers employ more precise and powerful control. While carrot  and milk cow breeders had to rely on diffuse organic evolution, modern genetic  engineers can use  directed artificial evolution-purposeful design—which greatly accelerates  improvements. The overlap of the mechanical and the lifelike increases year by year.  Part of this bionic convergence is a matter of words. The meanings of \"mechanical\" and  \"life\" are both stretching until all complicated things can be perceived as machines, and  all self-sustaining machines can be perceived as alive. Yet beyond semantics, two  concrete trends are happening: (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and  (2) Life is becoming more engineered. The apparent veil between the organic and the  manufactured has crumpled to reveal that the two really are, and have always been, of  one being.

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Many human phenomena and characteristics - such as behaviors, beliefs, economies, genes,  incomes, life expectancies, and other things - are influenced both by geographic factors and by  non-geographic factors. Geographic factors mean physical and biological factors tied to  geographic location, including climate, the distributions of wild plant and animal species, soils,  and topography. Non-geographic factors include those factors subsumed under the term  culture, other factors subsumed under the term history, and decisions by individual people....  [T]he differences between the current economies of North and South Korea ... cannot be  attributed to the modest environmental differences between [them] ... They are instead due  entirely to the different [government] policies ... At the opposite extreme, the Inuit and other  traditional peoples living north of the Arctic Circle developed warm fur clothes but no  agriculture, while equatorial lowland peoples around the world never developed warm fur  clothes but often did develop agriculture. The explanation is straightforwardly geographic,  rather than a cultural or historical quirk unrelated to geography. . . Aboriginal Australia  remained the sole continent occupied only by hunter/gatherers and with no indigenous farming  or herding ... [Here the] explanation is biogeographic: the Australian continent has no  domesticable native animal species and few domesticable native plant species. Instead, the  crops and domestic animals that now make Australia a food and wool exporter are all non- native (mainly Eurasian) species such as sheep, wheat, and grapes, brought to Australia by  overseas colonists.  Today, no scholar would be silly enough to deny that culture, history, and individual choices  play a big role in many human phenomena. Scholars don't react to cultural, historical, and  individual-agent explanations by denouncing \"cultural determinism,\" \"historical determinism,\"  or \"individual determinism,\" and then thinking no further. But many scholars do react to any  explanation invoking some geographic role, by denouncing \"geographic determinism\" ...    4  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  Several reasons may underlie this widespread but nonsensical view. One reason is that some  geographic explanations advanced a century ago were racist, thereby causing all geographic  explanations to become tainted by racist associations in the minds of many scholars other than  geographers. But many genetic, historical, psychological, and anthropological explanations  advanced a century ago were also racist, yet the validity of newer non-racist genetic etc.  explanations is widely accepted today.  Another reason for reflex rejection of geographic explanations is that historians have a  tradition, in their discipline, of stressing the role of contingency (a favorite word among  historians) based on individual decisions and chance. Often that view is warranted . . . But  often, too, that view is unwarranted. The development of warm fur clothes among the Inuit  living north of the Arctic Circle was not because one influential Inuit leader persuaded other  Inuit in 1783 to adopt warm fur clothes, for no good environmental reason.  A third reason is that geographic explanations usually depend on detailed technical facts of  geography and other fields of scholarship ... Most historians and economists don't acquire that  detailed knowledge as part of the professional training."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  [Fifty] years after its publication in English [in 1972], and just a year since [Marshall] Sahlins  himself died—we may ask: why did [his essay] \"Original Affluent Society\" have such an impact,  and how has it fared since? ... Sahlins's principal argument was simple but counterintuitive:  before being driven into marginal environments by colonial powers, huntergatherers, or  foragers, were not engaged in a desperate struggle for meager survival. Quite the contrary,  they satisfied their needs with far less work than people in agricultural and industrial societies,  leaving them more time to use as they wished. Hunters, he quipped, keep bankers' hours.  Refusing to maximize, many were \"more concerned with games of chance than with chances of  game.\" . . . The so-called Neolithic Revolution, rather than improving life, imposed a harsher  work regime and set in motion the long history of growing inequality ...  Moreover, foragers had other options. The contemporary Hadza of Tanzania, who had long  been surrounded by farmers, knew they had alternatives and rejected them. To Sahlins, this  showed that foragers are not simply examples of human diversity or victimhood but something  more profound: they demonstrated that societies make real choices. Culture, a way of living  oriented around a distinctive set of values, manifests a fundamental principle of collective self- determination. . .  But the point [of the essay] is not so much the empirical validity of the data-the real interest for  most readers, after all, is not in foragers either today or in the Paleolithic-but rather its  conceptual challenge to contemporary economic life and bourgeois individualism. The empirical    6  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  served a philosophical and political project, a thought experiment and stimulus to the  imagination of possibilities.  With its title's nod toward The Affluent Society (1958), economist John Kenneth Galbraith's  famously skeptical portrait of America's postwar prosperity and inequality, and dripping with  New Left contempt for consumerism, \"The Original Affluent Society\" brought this critical  perspective to bear on the contemporary world. It did so through the classic anthropological  move of showing that radical alternatives to the readers' lives really exist. If the capitalist world  seeks wealth through ever greater material production to meet infinitely expansive desires,  foraging societies follow \"the Zen road to affluence\": not by getting more, but by wanting less.  If it seems that foragers have been left behind by \"progress,\" this is due only to the  ethnocentric self-congratulation of the West. Rather than accumulate material goods, these  societies are guided by other values: leisure, mobility, and above all, freedom. . .  Viewed in today's context, of course, not every aspect of the essay has aged well. While  acknowledging the violence of colonialism, racism, and dispossession, it does not thematize  them as heavily as we might today. Rebuking evolutionary anthropologists for treating present- day foragers as \"left behind\" by progress, it too can succumb to the temptation to use them as  proxies for the Paleolithic. Yet these characteristics should not distract us from appreciating  Sahlins's effort to show that if we want to conjure new possibilities, we need to learn about  actually inhabitable worlds."

Comprehension:  The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  RESIDENTS of Lozère, a hilly department in southern France, recite complaints familiar to many  rural corners of Europe. In remote hamlets and villages, with names such as Le Bacon and Le  Bacon Vieux, mayors grumble about a lack of local schools, jobs, or phone and internet  connections. Farmers of grazing animals add another concern: the return of wolves. Eradicated  from France last century, the predators are gradually creeping back to more forests and  hillsides. \"The wolf must be taken in hand,\" said an aspiring parliamentarian, Francis Palombi,  when pressed by voters in an election campaign early this summer. Tourists enjoy visiting a  wolf park in Lozère, but farmers fret over their livestock and their livelihoods.  As early as the ninth century, the royal office of the Luparii-wolf-catchers-was created in France  to tackle the predators. Those official hunters (and others) completed their job in the 1930s,  when the last wolf disappeared from the mainland. Active hunting and improved technology  such as rifles in the 19th century, plus the use of poison such as strychnine later on, caused the    8  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  population collapse. But in the early 1990s the animals reappeared. They crossed the Alps from  Italy, upsetting sheep farmers on the French side of the border. Wolves have since spread to  areas such as Lozère, delighting environmentalists, who see the predators' presence as a sign of  wider ecological health. Farmers, who say the wolves cause the deaths of thousands of sheep  and other grazing animals, are less cheerful. They grumble that green activists and politically  correct urban types have allowed the return of an old enemy.  Various factors explain the changes of the past few decades. Rural depopulation is part of the  story. In Lozère, for example, farming and a once-flourishing mining industry supported a  population of over 140,000 residents in the mid- 19th century. Today the department has fewer  than 80,000 people, many in its towns. As humans withdraw, forests are expanding. In France,  between 1990 and 2015, forest cover increased by an average of 102,000 hectares each year,  as more fields were given over to trees. Now, nearly one-third of mainland France is covered by  woodland of some sort. The decline of hunting as a sport also means more forests fall quiet. In  the mid-to-late 20th century over 2m hunters regularly spent winter weekends tramping in  woodland, seeking boars, birds and other prey. Today the Fédération Nationale des Chasseurs,  the national body, claims 1.1 m people hold hunting licences, though the number of active  hunters is probably lower. The mostly protected status of the wolf in Europe-hunting them is  now forbidden, other than when occasional culls are sanctioned by the state-plus the efforts of  NGOs to track and count the animals, also contribute to the recovery of wolf populations.  As the lupine population of Europe spreads westwards, with occasional reports of wolves seen  closer to urban areas, expect to hear of more clashes between farmers and those who  celebrate the predators' return. Farmers' losses are real, but are not the only economic story.  Tourist venues, such as parks where wolves are kept and the animals' spread is discussed, also  generate income and jobs in rural areas."

It is a ‘theory of mind’ though some scholars prefer to call it ‘mentalizing’ or ‘mindreading’,  which is important for the development of one's cognitive abilities.  3. Though we must speculate about its evolutionary origin, we do have indications that the  capacity evolved sometime in the last few million years.  4. This capacity develops from early beginnings in the first year of life to the adult’s fast and  often effortless understanding of others’ thoughts, feelings, and intentions.   5. One of the most fascinating human capacities is the ability to perceive and interpret other  people’s behaviour in terms of their mental states."

Though \"algorithmic bias\" is the popular term, the foundation of such bias is not in  algorithms, but in the data; algorithms are not biased, data is, as algorithms merely reflect  persistent patterns that are present in the training data.  3. Despite their widespread impact, it is relatively easier to fix Al biases than human-generated  biases, as it is simpler to identify the former than to try to make people unlearn behaviors  learnt over generations.  4. The impact of biased decisions made by humans is localised and geographically confined,  but with the advent of Al, the impact of such decisions is spread over a much wider scale."

But the 21st century has seen  the weaponization of information on an unprecedented scale.

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.    3  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 02)  Over the past four centuries liberalism has been so successful that it has driven all its  opponents off the battlefield. Now it is disintegrating, destroyed by a mix of hubris and internal  contradictions, according to Patrick Deneen, a professor of politics at the University of Notre  Dame. . . . Equality of opportunity has produced a new meritocratic aristocracy that has all the  aloofness of the old aristocracy with none of its sense of noblesse oblige. Democracy has  degenerated into a theatre of the absurd. And technological advances are reducing ever more  areas of work into meaningless drudgery. “The gap between liberalism’s claims about itself and  the lived reality of the citizenry” is now so wide that “the lie can no longer be accepted,” Mr  Deneen writes. What better proof of this than the vision of 1,000 private planes whisking their  occupants to Davos to discuss the question of “creating a shared future in a fragmented  world”? . . .  Deneen does an impressive job of capturing the current mood of disillusionment, echoing left- wing complaints about rampant commercialism, right-wing complaints about narcissistic and  bullying students, and general worries about atomisation and selfishness. But when he  concludes that all this adds up to a failure of liberalism, is his argument convincing? . . . He  argues that the essence of liberalism lies in freeing individuals from constraints. In fact,  liberalism contains a wide range of intellectual traditions which provide different answers to  the question of how to trade off the relative claims of rights and responsibilities, individual  expression and social ties. . . . liberals experimented with a range of ideas from devolving power  from the centre to creating national education systems.  Mr Deneen’s fixation on the essence of liberalism leads to the second big problem of his book:  his failure to recognise liberalism’s ability to reform itself and address its internal problems. The  late 19th century saw America suffering from many of the problems that are reappearing today,  including the creation of a business aristocracy, the rise of vast companies, the corruption of  politics and the sense that society was dividing into winners and losers. But a wide variety of  reformers, working within the liberal tradition, tackled these problems head on. Theodore  Roosevelt took on the trusts. Progressives cleaned up government corruption. University  reformers modernised academic syllabuses and built ladders of opportunity. Rather than dying,  liberalism reformed itself.  Mr Deneen is right to point out that the record of liberalism in recent years has been dismal. He  is also right to assert that the world has much to learn from the premodern notions of liberty as  self-mastery and self-denial. The biggest enemy of liberalism is not so much atomisation but  old-fashioned greed, as members of the Davos elite pile their plates ever higher with perks and  share options. But he is wrong to argue that the only way for people to liberate themselves  from the contradictions of liberalism is “liberation from liberalism itself”. The best way to read  “Why Liberalism Failed” is not as a funeral oration but as a call to action: up your game, or else.    4  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 02)"

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Umberto Eco, an Italian writer, was right when he said the language of Europe is translation.  Netflix and other deep-pocketed global firms speak it well. Just as the EU employs a small army  of translators and interpreters to turn intricate laws or impassioned speeches of Romanian  MEPs into the EU’s 24 official languages, so do the likes of Netflix. It now offers dubbing in 34  languages and subtitling in a few more. . . .  The economics of European productions are more appealing, too. American audiences are  more willing than before to give dubbed or subtitled viewing a chance. This means shows such  as “Lupin”, a French crime caper on Netflix, can become global hits. . . . In 2015, about 75% of  Netflix’s original content was American; now the figure is half, according to Ampere, a media- analysis company. Netflix has about 100 productions under way in Europe, which is more than  big public broadcasters in France or Germany. . . .  Not everything works across borders. Comedy sometimes struggles. Whodunits and  bloodthirsty maelstroms between arch Romans and uppity tribesmen have a more universal  appeal. Some do it better than others. Barbarians aside, German television is not always built  for export, says one executive, being polite. A bigger problem is that national broadcasters still  dominate. Streaming services, such as Netflix or Disney+, account for about a third of all  viewing hours, even in markets where they are well-established. Europe is an ageing continent.  The generation of teens staring at phones is outnumbered by their elders who prefer to gawp  at the box.  In Brussels and national capitals, the prospect of Netflix as a cultural hegemon is seen as a  threat. “Cultural sovereignty” is the watchword of European executives worried that the  Americans will eat their lunch. To be fair, Netflix content sometimes seems stuck in an uncanny  valley somewhere in the mid-Atlantic, with local quirks stripped out. Netflix originals tend to  have fewer specific cultural references than shows produced by domestic rivals, according to  Enders, a market analyst. The company used to have an imperial model of commissioning, with  executives in Los Angeles cooking up ideas French people might like. Now Netflix has offices  across Europe. But ultimately the big decisions rest with American executives. This makes  European politicians nervous.  They should not be. An irony of European integration is that it is often American companies  that facilitate it. Google Translate makes European newspapers comprehensible, even if a little  clunky, for the continent’s non-polyglots. American social-media companies make it easier for  Europeans to talk politics across borders. (That they do not always like to hear what they say  about each other is another matter.) Now Netflix and friends pump the same content into    6  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 02)  homes across a continent, making culture a cross-border endeavour, too. If Europeans are to  share a currency, bail each other out in times of financial need and share vaccines in a  pandemic, then they need to have something in common—even if it is just bingeing on the  same series. Watching fictitious northern and southern Europeans tear each other apart 2,000  years ago beats doing so in reality."

    "option4": "filling an entertainment gap.  Comprehension:  The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  The Second Hand September campaign, led by Oxfam . . . seeks to encourage shopping at local  organisations and charities as alternatives to fast fashion brands such as Primark and Boohoo in  the name of saving our planet. As innocent as mindless scrolling through online shops may  seem, such consumers are unintentionally—or perhaps even knowingly—contributing to an  industry that uses more energy than aviation. . . .  Brits buy more garments than any other country in Europe, so it comes as no shock that many  of those clothes end up in UK landfills each year: 300,000 tonnes of them, to be exact. This  waste of clothing is destructive to our planet, releasing greenhouse gasses as clothes are burnt  as well as bleeding toxins and dyes into the surrounding soil and water. As ecologist Chelsea  Rochman bluntly put it, “The mismanagement of our waste has even come back to haunt us on  our dinner plate.”  It’s not surprising, then, that people are scrambling for a solution, the most common of which is  second-hand shopping. Retailers selling consigned clothing are currently expanding at a rapid  rate . . . If everyone bought just one used item in a year, it would save 449 million lbs of waste,  equivalent to the weight of 1 million Polar bears. “Thrifting” has increasingly become a trendy  practice. London is home to many second-hand, or more commonly coined ‘vintage’, shops  across the city from Bayswater to Brixton.  So you’re cool and you care about the planet; you’ve killed two birds with one stone. But do  people simply purchase a second-hand item, flash it on Instagram with #vintage and call it a day  without considering whether what they are doing is actually effective?  According to a study commissioned by Patagonia, for instance, older clothes shed more  microfibres. These can end up in our rivers and seas after just one wash due to the worn  material, thus contributing to microfibre pollution. To break it down, the amount of microfibres  released by laundering 100,000 fleece jackets is equivalent to as many as 11,900 plastic grocery  bags, and up to 40 per cent of that ends up in our oceans. . . . So where does this leave second- hand consumers? [They would be well advised to buy] high-quality items that shed less and last  longer [as this] combats both microfibre pollution and excess garments ending up in landfills. . .  .  Luxury brands would rather not circulate their latest season stock around the globe to be sold  at a cheaper price, which is why companies like ThredUP, a US fashion resale marketplace, have  not yet caught on in the UK. There will always be a market for consignment but there is also a    8  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 02)  whole generation of people who have been taught that only buying new products is the norm;  second-hand luxury goods are not in their psyche. Ben Whitaker, director at Liquidation Firm B- Stock, told Prospect that unless recycling becomes cost-effective and filters into mass  production, with the right technology to partner it, “high-end retailers would rather put brand  before sustainability.”"

Heatwaves are becoming longer, frequent and intense due to climate change. The impacts of  extreme heat are unevenly experienced; with older people and young children, those with pre- existing medical conditions and on low incomes significantly more vulnerable. Adaptation to  heatwaves is a significant public policy concern. Research conducted among at-risk people in  the UK reveals that even vulnerable people do not perceive themselves as at risk of extreme  heat; therefore, early warnings of extreme heat events do not perform as intended.

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Steven Pinker's new book, \"Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters,\" offers  a pragmatic dose of measured optimism, presenting rationality as a fragile but achievable ideal  in personal and civic life. ... Pinker's ambition to illuminate such a crucial topic offers the  welcome prospect of a return to sanity. ... It's no small achievement to make formal logic, game  theory, statistics and Bayesian reasoning delightful topics full of charm and relevance.  It's also plausible to believe that a wider application of the rational tools he analyzes would  improve the world in important ways. His primer on statistics and scientific uncertainty is  particularly timely and should be required reading before consuming any news about the  [COVID] pandemic. More broadly, he argues that less media coverage of shocking but  vanishingly rare events, from shark attacks to adverse vaccine reactions, would help prevent  dangerous overreactions, fatalism and the diversion of finite resources away from solvable but  less-dramatic issues, like malnutrition in the developing world.  It's a reasonable critique, and Pinker is not the first to make it. But analyzing the political  economy of journalism - its funding structures, ownership concentration and increasing reliance    4  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  on social media shares - would have given a fuller picture of why so much coverage is so  misguided and what we might do about it.  Pinker's main focus is the sort of conscious, sequential reasoning that can track the steps in a  geometric proof or an argument in formal logic. Skill in this domain maps directly onto the  navigation of many real-world problems, and Pinker shows how greater mastery of the tools of  rationality can improve decision-making in medical, legal, financial and many other contexts in  which we must act on uncertain and shifting information. ..  Despite the undeniable power of the sort of rationality he describes, many of the deepest  insights in the history of science, math, music and art strike their originators in moments of  epiphany. From the  th  19 -century chemist Friedrich August Kekulés discovery of the structure of  benzene to any of Mozart's symphonies, much extraordinary human achievement is not a  product of conscious, sequential reasoning. Even Plato's Socrates - who anticipated many of  Pinker's points by nearly 2,500 years, showing the virtue of knowing what you do not know and  examining all premises in arguments, not simply trusting speakers' authority or charisma -  attributed many of his most profound insights to dreams and visions. Conscious reasoning is  helpful in sorting the wheat from the chaff, but it would be interesting to consider the hidden  aquifers that make much of the grain grow in the first place.  The role of moral and ethical education in promoting rational behavior is also underexplored.  Pinker recognizes that rationality \"is not just a cognitive virtue but a moral one.\" But this  profoundly important point, one subtly explored by ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and  Aristotle, doesn't really get developed. This is a shame, since possessing the right sort of moral  character is arguably a precondition for using rationality in beneficial ways."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Understanding romantic aesthetics is not a simple undertaking for reasons that are internal to  the nature of the subject. Distinguished scholars, such as Arthur Lovejoy, Northrop Frye and  Isaiah Berlin, have remarked on the notorious challenges facing any attempt to define  romanticism. Lovejoy, for example, claimed that romanticism is \"the scandal of literary history  and criticism\"... The main difficulty in studying the romantics, according to him, is the lack of  any \"single real entity, or type of entity\" that the concept \"romanticism\" designates. Lovejoy  concluded, \"the word 'romantic' has come to mean so many things that, by itself, it means  nothing\"...    6  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  The more specific task of characterizing romantic aesthetics adds to these difficulties an air of  paradox. Conventionally, \"aesthetics\" refers to a theory concerning beauty and art or the  branch of philosophy that studies these topics. However, many of the romantics rejected the  identification of aesthetics with a circumscribed domain of human life that is separated from  the practical and theoretical domains of life. The most characteristic romantic commitment is to  the idea that the character of art and beauty and of our engagement with them should shape  all aspects of human life. Being fundamental to human existence, beauty and art should be a  central ingredient not only in a philosophical or artistic life, but also in the lives of ordinary men  and women. Another challenge for any attempt to characterize romantic aesthetics lies in the  fact that most of the romantics were poets and artists whose views of art and beauty are, for  the most part, to be found not in developed theoretical accounts, but in fragments, aphorisms  and poems, which are often more elusive and suggestive than conclusive.  Nevertheless, in spite of these challenges the task of characterizing romantic aesthetics is  neither impossible nor undesirable, as numerous thinkers responding to Lovejoy's radical  skepticism have noted. While warning against a reductive definition of romanticism, Berlin, for  example, still heralded the need for a general characterization: \"[Although] one does have a  certain sympathy with Lovejoy's despair...[he is] in this instance mistaken. There was a romantic  movement...and it is important to discover what it is\" ...  Recent attempts to characterize romanticism and to stress its contemporary relevance follow  this path. Instead of overlooking the undeniable differences between the variety of  romanticisms of different nations that Lovejoy had stressed, such studies attempt to  characterize romanticism, not in terms of a single definition, a specific time, or a specific place,  but in terms of \"particular philosophical questions and concerns\" ...  While the German, British and French romantics are all considered, the central protagonists in  the following are the German romantics. Two reasons explain this focus: first, because it has  paved the way for the other romanticisms, German romanticism has a pride of place among the  different national romanticisms ... Second, the aesthetic outlook that was developed in  Germany roughly between 1796 and 1801 02 −  - the period that corresponds to the heyday of  what is known as \"Early Romanticism\" ...- offers the most philosophical expression of  romanticism since it is grounded primarily in the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and  political concerns that the German romantics discerned in the aftermath of Kant's philosophy."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  The biggest challenge [The Nutmeg's Curse by Ghosh] throws down is to the prevailing  understanding of when the climate crisis started. Most of us have accepted ... that it started  with the widespread use of coal at the beginning of the Industrial Age in the 18th  century and  worsened with the mass adoption of oil and natural gas in the 20th.    8  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  Ghosh takes this history at least three centuries back, to the start of European colonialism in  the 15th century. He [starts] the book with a 1621 massacre by Dutch invaders determined to  impose a monopoly on nutmeg cultivation and trade in the Banda islands in today's Indonesia.  Not only do the Dutch systematically depopulate the islands through genocide, they also try  their best to bring nutmeg cultivation into plantation mode. These are the two points to which  Ghosh returns through examples from around the world. One, how European colonialists  decimated not only indigenous populations but also indigenous understanding of the  relationship between humans and Earth. Two, how this was an invasion not only of humans but  of the Earth itself, and how this continues to the present day by looking at nature as a  'resource' to exploit. ...  We know we are facing more frequent and more severe heatwaves, storms, floods, droughts  and wildfires due to climate change. We know our expansion through deforestation, dam  building, canal cutting - in short, terraforming, the word Ghosh uses - has brought us repeated  disasters ... Are these the responses of an angry Gaia who has finally had enough? By using the  word 'curse' in the title, the author makes it clear that he thinks so. I use the pronoun 'who'  knowingly, because Ghosh has quoted many non-European sources to enquire into the  relationship between humans and the world around them so that he can question the  prevalent way of looking at Earth as an inert object to be exploited to the maximum.  As Ghosh's text, notes and bibliography show once more, none of this is new. There have  always been challenges to the way European colonialists looked at other civilisations and at  Earth. It is just that the invaders and their myriad backers in the fields of economics, politics,  anthropology, philosophy, literature, technology, physics, chemistry, biology have dominated  global intellectual discourse....  There are other points of view that we can hear today if we listen hard enough. Those  observing global climate negotiations know about the Latin American way of looking at Earth as  Pachamama (Earth Mother). They also know how such a framing is just provided lip service and  is ignored in the substantive portions of the negotiations. In The Nutmeg's Curse, Ghosh  explains why. He shows the extent of the vested interest in the oil economy - not only for oil- exporting countries, but also for a superpower like the US that controls oil drilling, oil prices and  oil movement around the world. Many of us know power utilities are sabotaging decentralised  solar power generation today because it hits their revenues and control. And how the other  points of view are so often drowned out."

An argument can be defined as a complex symbolic structure where some parts,  known as the premises, offer support to another part, the conclusion. Alternatively, an  argument can be viewed as a complex speech act consisting of one or more acts of premising  (which assert propositions in favor of the conclusion), an act of concluding, and a stated or  implicit marker (\"hence\", \"therefore\") that indicates that the conclusion follows from the  premises.. (2)_. The relation of support between premises and conclusion can be cashed out in  different ways: the premises may guarantee the truth of the conclusion, or make its truth more  probable; the premises may imply the conclusion; the premises may make the conclusion more  acceptable (or assertible).(3)__.

    "option4": "Option 4  The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Oftentimes, when economists cross borders, they are less interested in learning from others  than in invading their garden plots. Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human  capital. To do so, he famously tackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods  honed in the study of markets to domains of nonmarket life. He projected economics outward  into new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to which humans calculate marginal  utilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the same time, he did not  let other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not borrow from  anthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo  economicus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyday of the discipline's  bravura.  Times have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task, within  and beyond its ramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and  collaborated—been less imperial, more open. Consider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to  historians. The booming field of behavioral economics-the fusion of economics and social  psychology-is another case. Having spawned active subfields, like judgment, decisionmaking      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    and a turn to experimentation, the field aims to go beyond the caricature of Rational Man to  explain how humans make decisions....  It is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For generations,  economists have presumed that people have interests-\"preferences,\" in the neoclassical argot- that get revealed in the course of peoples' choices. Interests come before actions and  determine them. If you are hungry, you buy lunch; if you are cold, you get a sweater. If you only  have so much money and can't afford to deal with both your growling stomach and your  shivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings reveals your preference.  Psychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly, even  some mainstream economists have to admit that homo economicus doesn't always behave like  the textbook maximizer; irrational behavior can't simply be waved away as extraeconomic  expressions of passions over interests, and thus the domain of other disciplines.... This is one  place where the humanist can help the economist. If narrative economics is going to help us  understand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who loses, we are going to need much more  than lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial stimuli.  Above all, we need politics and institutions. Shiller [the Nobel prize winning economist]  connects perceptions of narratives to changes in behavior and thence to social outcomes. He  completes a circle that was key to behavioral economics and brings in storytelling to make  sense of how perceptions get framed. This cycle (perception to behavior to society) was once  mediated or dominated by institutions: the political parties, lobby groups, and media  organizations that played a vital role in legitimating, representing, and excluding interests. Yet  institutions have been stripped from Shiller's account, to reveal a bare dynamic of emotions  and economics, without the intermediating place of politics."

Certain codes may, of course, be so widely distributed in a specific language community or  culture, and be learned at so early an age, that they appear not to be constructed - the effect of  an articulation between sign and referent - but to be 'naturally' given. Simple visual signs  appear to have achieved a 'near-universality' in this sense: though evidence remains that even  apparently 'natural' visual codes are culture specific.

The operation  of naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and 'naturalness' of language but the depth,  the habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use.

The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  In the summer of 2022, subscribers to the US streaming service HBO MAX were alarmed to  discover that dozens of the platform's offerings - from the Covid-themed heist thriller Locked  Down to the recent remake of The Witches - had been quietly removed from the service . . .  The news seemed like vindication to those who had long warned that streaming was more  about controlling access to the cultural commons than expanding it, as did reports (since  denied by the show's creators) that Netflix had begun editing old episodes of Stranger Things to  retroactively improve their visual effects.  What's less clear is whether the commonly prescribed cure for these cultural ills - a return to  the material pleasures of physical media - is the right one. While the makers of Blu-ray discs  claim they have a shelf life of 100 years, such statistics remain largely theoretical until they  come to pass, and are dependent on storage conditions, not to mention the continued  availability of playback equipment. The humble DVD has already proved far less resilient, with  many early releases already beginning to deteriorate in quality Digital movie purchases provide  even less security. Any film \"bought\" on iTunes could disappear if you move to another territory  with a different rights agreement and try to redownload it. It's a bold new frontier in the      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    commodification of art: the birth of the product recall. After a man took to Twitter to bemoan  losing access to Cars 2 after moving from Canada to Australia, Apple clarified that users who  downloaded films to their devices would retain permanent access to those downloads, even if  they relocated to a hemisphere where the [content was] subject to a different set of rights  agreements. Thanks to the company's ironclad digital rights management technology, however,  such files cannot be moved or backed up, locking you into watching with your Apple account.  Anyone who does manage to acquire Digital Rights Management free (DRM-free) copies of  their favourite films must nonetheless grapple with ever-changing file format standards, not to  mention data decay - the gradual process by which electronic information slowly but surely  corrupts. Only the regular migration of files from hard drive to hard drive can delay the  inevitable, in a sisyphean battle against the ravages of digital time.  In a sense, none of this is new. Charlie Chaplin burned the negative of his 1926 film A Woman of  the Sea as a tax write-off. Many more films have been lost through accident, negligence or plain  indifference. During a heatwave in July 1937, a Fox film vault in New Jersey burned down,  destroying a majority of the silent films produced by the studio.  Back then, at least, cinema was defined by its ephemerality: the sense that a film was as good  as gone once it left your local cinema. Today, with film studios keen to stress the breadth of  their back catalogues (or to put in Hollywood terms, the value of their IPs), audiences may start  to wonder why those same studios seem happy to set the vault alight themselves if it'll help  next quarter's numbers."

The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  . . . [T]he idea of craftsmanship is not simply nostalgic. . . . Crafts require distinct skills, an  allround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an  attitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The  concept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    Essentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management  studies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . . Craft  skills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist.  The contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19th  century when  British manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed  the \"American system\" using standardised parts. . . the worldwide success of the Singer sewing  machine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own  reaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19 th century, and then  again in the \"small is beautiful\" movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as  people become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry.  There are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the  existence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to  be of extra quality. . . . The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their  purchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to  craftspeople to be mended, or recycled.  For workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative  choices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the  overall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers  focus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite  the \"agile\" manifesto in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change.  The pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \"individuals and  interactions over processes and tools\". By bringing together experts from different teams, agile  working is designed to improve creativity.  But the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today.  Demand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might  get automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and  services often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the  advantage.  History also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft  guilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants. They were also highly hierarchical with  young men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could  set up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them.  Craft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don't get too organised."

The UK is a world leader in developing cultivated meat and the approval of a cultivated pet  food is an important milestone.  2. If we're to realize the full potential benefits of cultivated meat the government must invest  in research and infrastructure.  3. The first UK applications for cultivated meat produced for humans remain under  assessment with the Food Standards Agency.  4. The previous UK government had been looking at fast-tracking the approval of cultivated  meat for human consumption.  5. It underscores the potential for new innovation to help reduce the negative impacts of  intensive animal agriculture.    The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  (. . .) There are three other common drivers for carnivore-human attacks, some of which are  more preventable than others. Natural aggression-based conflicts - such as those involving  females protecting their young or animals protecting a food source - can often be avoided as  long as people stay away from those animals and their food.  Carnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. As they become  more reliant on human food they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they become less  avoidant of humans. Losing that instinctive fear response puts them into more situations where  they could get into an altercation with a human, which often results in that bear being put  down by humans. \"A fed bear is a dead bear,\" says Servheen, referring to a common saying  among biologists and conservationists.  Predatory or predation-related attacks are quite rare, only accounting for 17% of attacks in  North America since 1955. They occur when a carnivore views a human as prey and hunts it like  it would any other animal it uses for food. (. . .)  Then there are animal attacks provoked by people taking pictures with them or feeding them in  natural settings such as national parks which often end with animals being euthanised out of  precaution. \"Eventually, that animal becomes habituated to people, and [then] bad things      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    happen to the animal. And the folks who initially wanted to make that connection don't  necessarily realise that,\" says Christine Wilkinson, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley,  California, who's been studying coyote-human conflicts.  After conducting countless postmortems on all types of carnivore-human attacks spanning 75  years, Penteriani's team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans reacted differently.  A 2017 study co-authored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around large  carnivores increases the likelihood of an attack  Two of the most common risky behaviours are parents leaving their children to play outside  unattended and walking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of  coyote attacks involve a dog. \"[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased, or  their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they're walking their dog near a den that's marked, and the  coyote wants to escort them away,\" says Wilkinson.  Experts believe climate change also plays a part in the escalation of human-carnivore conflicts,  but the correlation still needs to be ironed out. \"As finite resources become scarcer, carnivores  and people are coming into more frequent contact, which means that more conflict could  occur,\" says Jen Miller, international programme specialist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service.  For example, she says, there was an uptick in lion attacks in western India during a drought  when lions and people were relying on the same water sources.  (. . .) The likelihood of human-carnivore conflicts appears to be higher in areas of low-income  countries dominated by vast rural landscapes and farmland, according to Penteriani's research.  \"There are a lot of working landscapes in the Global South that are really heterogeneous, that  are interspersed with carnivore habitats, forests and savannahs, which creates a lot more  opportunity for these encounters, just statistically,\" says Wilkinson."

[S]pices were a global commodity centuries before European voyages. There was a complex  chain of relations, yet consumers had little knowledge of producers and vice versa. Desire for  spices helped fuel European colonial empires to create political, military and commercial  networks under a single power.  Historians know a fair amount about the supply of spices in Europe during the medieval period -  the origins, methods of transportation, the prices - but less about demand. Why go to such      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    extraordinary efforts to procure expensive products from exotic lands? Still, demand was great  enough to inspire the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama, launching the first  fateful wave of European colonialism. . . .  So, why were spices so highly prized in Europe in the centuries from about 1000 to 1500? One  widely disseminated explanation for medieval demand for spices was that they covered the  taste of spoiled meat. . . . Medieval purchasers consumed meat much fresher than what the  average city-dweller in the developed world of today has at hand. However, refrigeration was  not available, and some hot spices have been shown to serve as an anti-bacterial agent. Salting,  smoking or drying meat were other means of preservation. Most spices used in cooking began  as medical ingredients, and throughout the Middle Ages spices were used as both medicines  and condiments. Above all, medieval recipes involve the combination of medical and culinary  lore in order to balance food's humeral properties and prevent disease. Most spices were hot  and dry and so appropriate in sauces to counteract the moist and wet properties supposedly  possessed by most meat and fish. . . .  Where spices came from was known in a vague sense centuries before the voyages of  Columbus. Just how vague may be judged by looking at medieval world maps . . . To the  medieval European imagination, the East was exotic and alluring. Medieval maps often placed  India close to the so-called Earthly Paradise, the Garden of Eden described in the Bible.  Geographical knowledge has a lot to do with the perceptions of spices' relative scarcity and the  reasons for their high prices. An example of the varying notions of scarcity is the conflicting  information about how pepper is harvested. As far back as the 7th  century Europeans thought  that pepper in India grew on trees \"guarded\" by serpents that would bite and poison anyone  who attempted to gather the fruit. The only way to harvest pepper was to burn the trees, which  would drive the snakes underground. Of course, this bit of lore would explain the shriveled  black peppercorns, but not white, pink or other colors.  Spices never had the enduring allure or power of gold and silver or the commercial potential of  new products such as tobacco, indigo or sugar. But the taste for spices did continue for a while  beyond the Middle Ages. As late as the 17th  century, the English and the Dutch were struggling  for control of the Spice Islands: Dutch New Amsterdam, or New York, was exchanged by the  British for one of the Moluccan Islands where nutmeg was grown."

The history of any major technological or industrial advance is inevitably shadowed by a less  predictable history of unintended consequences and secondary effects - what economists  sometimes call \"externalities.\" Sometimes those consequences are innocuous ones, or even  beneficial. Gutenberg invents the printing press, and literacy rates rise, which causes a  significant part of the reading public to require spectacles for the first time, which creates a  surge of investment in lens-making across Europe, which leads to the invention of the telescope  and the microscope.  Oftentimes the secondary effects seem to belong to an entirely different sphere of society.  When Willis Carrier hit upon the idea of air-conditioning, the technology was primarily intended  for industrial use: ensuring cool, dry air for factories that required low-humidity environments.      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    But...it touched off one of the largest migrations in the history of the United States, enabling  the rise of metropolitan areas like Phoenix and Las Vegas that barely existed when Carrier first  started tinkering with the idea in the early 1900s.  Sometimes the unintended consequence comes about when consumers use an invention in a  surprising way. Edison famously thought his phonograph, which he sometimes called \"the  talking machine,\" would primarily be used to take dictation....But then later innovators...  discovered a much larger audience willing to pay for musical recordings made on descendants  of Edison's original invention. In other cases, the original innovation comes into the world  disguised as a plaything...the way the animatronic dolls of the mid-1700s inspired Jacquard to  invent the first \"programmable\" loom and Charles Babbage to invent the first machine that fit  the modern definition of a computer, setting the stage for the revolution in programmable  technology that would transform the 21 st century in countless ways.  We live under the gathering storm of modern history's most momentous unintended  consequence....carbon-based climate change. Imagine the vast sweep of inventors whose ideas  started the Industrial Revolution, all the entrepreneurs and scientists and hobbyists who had a  hand in bringing it about. Line up a thousand of them and ask them all what they had been  hoping to do with their work. Not one would say that their intent had been to deposit enough  carbon in the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect that trapped heat at the surface of the  planet. And yet here we are.  Ethyl (leaded fuel) and Freon belonged to the same general class of secondary effect  innovations whose unintended consequences stem from some kind of waste by-product that  they emit. But the potential health threats of Ethyl (unleaded fuel) were visible in the 1920s,  unlike, say, the long-term effects of atmospheric carbon build up in the early days of the  Industrial Revolution...  Indeed, it is reasonable to see CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) as a forerunner of the kind of threat  we will most likely face in the coming decades, as it becomes increasingly possible for  individuals or small groups to create new scientific advances - through chemistry or  biotechnology or materials science - setting off unintended consequences that reverberate on a  global scale."

Comprehension:  The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  The job of a peer reviewer is thankless. Collectively, academics spend around 70 million hours  every year evaluating each other's manuscripts on the behalf of scholarly journals and they      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    usually receive no monetary compensation and little if any recognition for their effort. Some do  it as a way to keep abreast with developments in their field; some simply see it as a duty to the  discipline. Either way, academic publishing would likely crumble without them.  In recent years, some scientists have begun posting their reviews online, mainly to claim credit  for their work. Sites like Publons allow researchers to either share entire referee reports or  simply list the journals for whom they've carried out a review....  The rise of Publons suggests that academics are increasingly placing value on the work of peer  review and asking others, such as grant funders, to do the same. While that's vital in the  publish-or-perish culture of academia, there's also immense value in the data underlying peer  review. Sharing peer review data could help journals stamp out fraud, inefficiency, and systemic  bias in academic publishing.....  Peer review data could also help root out bias. Last year, a study based on peer review data for  nearly 24,000 submissions to the biomedical journal eLife found that women and  nonWesterners were vastly underrepresented among peer reviewers. Only around one in every  five reviewers was female, and less than two percent of reviewers were based in developing  countries.... Openly publishing peer review data could perhaps also help journals address  another problem in academic publishing: fraudulent peer reviews. For instance, a minority of  authors have been known to use phony email addresses to pose as an outside expert and  review their own manuscripts....  Opponents of open peer review commonly argue that confidentiality is vital to the integrity of  the review process; referees may be less critical of manuscripts if their reports are published,  especially if they are revealing their identities by signing them. Some also hold concerns that  open reviewing may deter referees from agreeing to judge manuscripts in the first place, or  that they'll take longer to do so out of fear of scrutiny....  Even when the content of reviews and the identity of reviewers can't be shared publicly,  perhaps journals could share the data with outside researchers for study. Or they could release  other figures that wouldn't compromise the anonymity of reviews but that might answer  important questions about how long the reviewing process takes, how many researchers  editors have to reach out to on average to find one who will carry out the work, and the  geographic distribution of peer reviewers.  Of course, opening up data underlying the reviewing process will not fix peer review entirely,  and there may be instances in which there are valid reasons to keep the content of peer  reviews hidden and the identity of the referees confidential. But the norm should shift from  opacity in all cases to opacity only when necessary."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Steven Pinker's new book, \"Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters,\" offers  a pragmatic dose of measured optimism, presenting rationality as a fragile but achievable ideal  in personal and civic life. ... Pinker's ambition to illuminate such a crucial topic offers the  welcome prospect of a return to sanity. ... It's no small achievement to make formal logic, game  theory, statistics and Bayesian reasoning delightful topics full of charm and relevance.  It's also plausible to believe that a wider application of the rational tools he analyzes would  improve the world in important ways. His primer on statistics and scientific uncertainty is  particularly timely and should be required reading before consuming any news about the  [COVID] pandemic. More broadly, he argues that less media coverage of shocking but  vanishingly rare events, from shark attacks to adverse vaccine reactions, would help prevent  dangerous overreactions, fatalism and the diversion of finite resources away from solvable but  less-dramatic issues, like malnutrition in the developing world.  It's a reasonable critique, and Pinker is not the first to make it. But analyzing the political  economy of journalism - its funding structures, ownership concentration and increasing reliance    4  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  on social media shares - would have given a fuller picture of why so much coverage is so  misguided and what we might do about it.  Pinker's main focus is the sort of conscious, sequential reasoning that can track the steps in a  geometric proof or an argument in formal logic. Skill in this domain maps directly onto the  navigation of many real-world problems, and Pinker shows how greater mastery of the tools of  rationality can improve decision-making in medical, legal, financial and many other contexts in  which we must act on uncertain and shifting information. ..  Despite the undeniable power of the sort of rationality he describes, many of the deepest  insights in the history of science, math, music and art strike their originators in moments of  epiphany. From the  th  19 -century chemist Friedrich August Kekulés discovery of the structure of  benzene to any of Mozart's symphonies, much extraordinary human achievement is not a  product of conscious, sequential reasoning. Even Plato's Socrates - who anticipated many of  Pinker's points by nearly 2,500 years, showing the virtue of knowing what you do not know and  examining all premises in arguments, not simply trusting speakers' authority or charisma -  attributed many of his most profound insights to dreams and visions. Conscious reasoning is  helpful in sorting the wheat from the chaff, but it would be interesting to consider the hidden  aquifers that make much of the grain grow in the first place.  The role of moral and ethical education in promoting rational behavior is also underexplored.  Pinker recognizes that rationality \"is not just a cognitive virtue but a moral one.\" But this  profoundly important point, one subtly explored by ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and  Aristotle, doesn't really get developed. This is a shame, since possessing the right sort of moral  character is arguably a precondition for using rationality in beneficial ways."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Understanding romantic aesthetics is not a simple undertaking for reasons that are internal to  the nature of the subject. Distinguished scholars, such as Arthur Lovejoy, Northrop Frye and  Isaiah Berlin, have remarked on the notorious challenges facing any attempt to define  romanticism. Lovejoy, for example, claimed that romanticism is \"the scandal of literary history  and criticism\"... The main difficulty in studying the romantics, according to him, is the lack of  any \"single real entity, or type of entity\" that the concept \"romanticism\" designates. Lovejoy  concluded, \"the word 'romantic' has come to mean so many things that, by itself, it means  nothing\"...    6  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  The more specific task of characterizing romantic aesthetics adds to these difficulties an air of  paradox. Conventionally, \"aesthetics\" refers to a theory concerning beauty and art or the  branch of philosophy that studies these topics. However, many of the romantics rejected the  identification of aesthetics with a circumscribed domain of human life that is separated from  the practical and theoretical domains of life. The most characteristic romantic commitment is to  the idea that the character of art and beauty and of our engagement with them should shape  all aspects of human life. Being fundamental to human existence, beauty and art should be a  central ingredient not only in a philosophical or artistic life, but also in the lives of ordinary men  and women. Another challenge for any attempt to characterize romantic aesthetics lies in the  fact that most of the romantics were poets and artists whose views of art and beauty are, for  the most part, to be found not in developed theoretical accounts, but in fragments, aphorisms  and poems, which are often more elusive and suggestive than conclusive.  Nevertheless, in spite of these challenges the task of characterizing romantic aesthetics is  neither impossible nor undesirable, as numerous thinkers responding to Lovejoy's radical  skepticism have noted. While warning against a reductive definition of romanticism, Berlin, for  example, still heralded the need for a general characterization: \"[Although] one does have a  certain sympathy with Lovejoy's despair...[he is] in this instance mistaken. There was a romantic  movement...and it is important to discover what it is\" ...  Recent attempts to characterize romanticism and to stress its contemporary relevance follow  this path. Instead of overlooking the undeniable differences between the variety of  romanticisms of different nations that Lovejoy had stressed, such studies attempt to  characterize romanticism, not in terms of a single definition, a specific time, or a specific place,  but in terms of \"particular philosophical questions and concerns\" ...  While the German, British and French romantics are all considered, the central protagonists in  the following are the German romantics. Two reasons explain this focus: first, because it has  paved the way for the other romanticisms, German romanticism has a pride of place among the  different national romanticisms ... Second, the aesthetic outlook that was developed in  Germany roughly between 1796 and 1801 02 −  - the period that corresponds to the heyday of  what is known as \"Early Romanticism\" ...- offers the most philosophical expression of  romanticism since it is grounded primarily in the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and  political concerns that the German romantics discerned in the aftermath of Kant's philosophy."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  The biggest challenge [The Nutmeg's Curse by Ghosh] throws down is to the prevailing  understanding of when the climate crisis started. Most of us have accepted ... that it started  with the widespread use of coal at the beginning of the Industrial Age in the 18th  century and  worsened with the mass adoption of oil and natural gas in the 20th.    8  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 03)  Ghosh takes this history at least three centuries back, to the start of European colonialism in  the 15th century. He [starts] the book with a 1621 massacre by Dutch invaders determined to  impose a monopoly on nutmeg cultivation and trade in the Banda islands in today's Indonesia.  Not only do the Dutch systematically depopulate the islands through genocide, they also try  their best to bring nutmeg cultivation into plantation mode. These are the two points to which  Ghosh returns through examples from around the world. One, how European colonialists  decimated not only indigenous populations but also indigenous understanding of the  relationship between humans and Earth. Two, how this was an invasion not only of humans but  of the Earth itself, and how this continues to the present day by looking at nature as a  'resource' to exploit. ...  We know we are facing more frequent and more severe heatwaves, storms, floods, droughts  and wildfires due to climate change. We know our expansion through deforestation, dam  building, canal cutting - in short, terraforming, the word Ghosh uses - has brought us repeated  disasters ... Are these the responses of an angry Gaia who has finally had enough? By using the  word 'curse' in the title, the author makes it clear that he thinks so. I use the pronoun 'who'  knowingly, because Ghosh has quoted many non-European sources to enquire into the  relationship between humans and the world around them so that he can question the  prevalent way of looking at Earth as an inert object to be exploited to the maximum.  As Ghosh's text, notes and bibliography show once more, none of this is new. There have  always been challenges to the way European colonialists looked at other civilisations and at  Earth. It is just that the invaders and their myriad backers in the fields of economics, politics,  anthropology, philosophy, literature, technology, physics, chemistry, biology have dominated  global intellectual discourse....  There are other points of view that we can hear today if we listen hard enough. Those  observing global climate negotiations know about the Latin American way of looking at Earth as  Pachamama (Earth Mother). They also know how such a framing is just provided lip service and  is ignored in the substantive portions of the negotiations. In The Nutmeg's Curse, Ghosh  explains why. He shows the extent of the vested interest in the oil economy - not only for oil- exporting countries, but also for a superpower like the US that controls oil drilling, oil prices and  oil movement around the world. Many of us know power utilities are sabotaging decentralised  solar power generation today because it hits their revenues and control. And how the other  points of view are so often drowned out."

Centuries later formal learning is still mostly based on reading, even with the widespread  use of other possible education-affecting technologies such as film, radio, and television.  2. One of the immediate and recognisable impacts of the printing press was on how people  learned; in the scribal culture it primarily involved listening, so memorization was  paramount.  3. The transformation of learners from listeners to readers was a complex social and cultural  phenomenon, and it was not until the industrial era that the concept of universal literacy  took root.  4. The printing press shifted the learning process, as listening and memorisation gradually  gave way to reading and learning no longer required the presence of a mentor; it could be  done privately."
