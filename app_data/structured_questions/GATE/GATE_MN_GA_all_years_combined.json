After two or  three such mortifying Sunday evenings, the mother stopped going to church  altogether until Apenyo became older and learnt to behave.  At home too, Apenyo never kept quiet; she hummed or made up silly songs  to sing by herself, which annoyed her mother at times but most often made  her become pensive.
