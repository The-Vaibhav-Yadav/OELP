Due to lack of adequate covid-testing kits, the health authorities of the town devised  a strategy to identify these covid-positive individuals. The strategy is to:  (i)  Collect saliva samples from all 1000 individuals and randomly group  them into sets of 5.   (ii)  Mix the samples within each set and test the mixed sample for covid.   (iii)  If the test done in (ii) gives a negative result, then declare all the 5  individuals to be covid negative.   (iv)  If the test done in (ii) gives a positive result, then all the 5 individuals  are separately tested for covid.  Given this strategy, no more than _______ testing kits will be required to identify  all the 100 covid positive individuals irrespective of how they are grouped.",

When the congregation sang together, Apenyo would also join, though her  little screams were not quite audible because of the group singing. But  whenever there was a special number, trouble would begin; Apenyo would  try singing along, much to the embarrassment of her mother. After two or  three such mortifying Sunday evenings, the mother stopped going to church  altogether until Apenyo became older and learnt to behave.  At home too, Apenyo never kept quiet; she hummed or made up silly songs  to sing by herself, which annoyed her mother at times but most often made  her become pensive. She was by now convinced that her daughter had  inherited her love of singing from her father who had died unexpectedly  away from home.    [Excerpt from These Hills Called Home by Temsula Ao]",

Dark matter is supposed  to interact only via the gravitational interaction and not through the  electromagnetic-, the weak- or the strong-interaction. This may justify the epithet  “dark” in dark matter.  Based on the above paragraph, which one of the following statements is FALSE?",
