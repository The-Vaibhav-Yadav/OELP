Choose the best answer to each question.  The Chinese have two different concepts of a copy. Fangzhipin . . . are imitations where the difference from  the original is obvious. These are small models or copies that can be purchased in a museum shop, for  example. The second concept for a copy is fuzhipin . . . They are exact reproductions of the original, which,  for the Chinese, are of equal value to the original. It has absolutely no negative connotations. The  discrepancy with regard to the understanding of what a copy is has often led to misunderstandings and  arguments between China and Western museums. The Chinese often send copies abroad instead of originals,  in the firm belief that they are not essentially different from the originals. The rejection that then comes  from the Western museums is perceived by the Chinese as an insult. . . .  The Far Eastern notion of identity is also very confusing to the Western observer. The Ise Grand Shrine [in  Japan] is 1,300 years old for the millions of Japanese people who go there on pilgrimage every year. But in  reality this temple complex is completely rebuilt from scratch every 20 years. . . .  The cathedral of Freiburg Minster in southwest Germany is covered in scaffolding almost all year round. The  sandstone from which it is built is a very soft, porous material that does not withstand natural erosion by rain  and wind. After a while, it crumbles. As a result, the cathedral is continually being examined for damage, and  eroded stones are replaced. And in the cathedral\u2019s dedicated workshop, copies of the damaged sandstone  figures are constantly being produced. Of course, attempts are made to preserve the stones from the Middle  Ages for as long as possible. But at some point they, too, are removed and replaced with new stones.  Fundamentally, this is the same operation as with the Japanese shrine, except in this case the production of a  replica takes place very slowly and over long periods of time. . . . In the field of art as well, the idea of an  unassailable original developed historically in the Western world. Back in the 17th century [in the West],  excavated artworks from antiquity were treated quite differently from today. They were not restored in a  way that was faithful to the original. Instead, there was massive intervention in these works, changing their  appearance. . . .  It is probably this intellectual position that explains why Asians have far fewer scruples about cloning than  Europeans. The South Korean cloning researcher Hwang Woo-suk, who attracted worldwide attention with  his cloning experiments in 2004, is a Buddhist. He found a great deal of support and followers among  Buddhists, while Christians called for a ban on human cloning. . . . Hwang legitimised his cloning experiments  with his religious affiliation: \u2018I am Buddhist, and I have no philosophical problem with cloning. And as you  know, the basis of Buddhism is that life is recycled through reincarnation. In some ways, I think, therapeutic  cloning restarts the circle of life.\u2019"

Choose the best answer to each question.  Critical theory of technology is a political theory of modernity with a normative dimension. It belongs to a  tradition extending from Marx to Foucault and Habermas according to which advances in the formal claims  of human rights take center stage while in the background centralization of ever more powerful public  institutions and private organizations imposes an authoritarian social order.  Marx attributed this trajectory to the capitalist rationalization of production. Today it marks many  https://bodheeprep.com    CAT 2022 Question Paper (Slot 1)  institutions besides the factory and every modern political system, including so-called socialist systems. This  trajectory arose from the problems of command over a disempowered and deskilled labor force; but  everywhere [that] masses are organized \u2013 whether it be Foucault\u2019s prisons or Habermas\u2019s public sphere \u2013 the  same pattern prevails. Technological design and development is shaped by this pattern as the material base  of a distinctive social order. Marcuse would later point to a \u201cproject\u201d as the basis of what he called rather  confusingly \u201ctechnological rationality.\u201d Releasing technology from this project is a democratic political task.  In accordance with this general line of thought, critical theory of technology regards technologies as an  environment rather than as a collection of tools. We live today with and even within technologies that  determine our way of life. Along with the constant pressures to build centers of power, many other social  values and meanings are inscribed in technological design. A hermeneutics of technology must make explicit  the meanings implicit in the devices we use and the rituals they script. Social histories of technologies such as  the bicycle, artificial lighting or firearms have made important contributions to this type of analysis. Critical  theory of technology attempts to build a methodological approach on the lessons of these histories.  As an environment, technologies shape their inhabitants. In this respect, they are comparable to laws and  customs. Each of these institutions can be said to represent those who live under their sway through  privileging certain dimensions of their human nature. Laws of property represent the interest in ownership  and control. Customs such as parental authority represent the interest of childhood in safety and growth.  Similarly, the automobile represents its users in so far as they are interested in mobility. Interests such as  these constitute the version of human nature sanctioned by society.  This notion of representation does not imply an eternal human nature. The concept of nature as non-identity  in the Frankfurt School suggests an alternative. On these terms, nature is what lies at the limit of history, at  the point at which society loses the capacity to imprint its meanings on things and control them effectively.  The reference here is, of course, not to the nature of natural science, but to the lived nature in which we find  ourselves and which we are. This nature reveals itself as that which cannot be totally encompassed by the  machinery of society. For the Frankfurt School, human nature, in all its transcending force, emerges out of a  historical context as that context is [depicted] in illicit joys, struggles and pathologies. We can perhaps admit  a less romantic . . . conception in which those dimensions of human nature recognized by society are also  granted theoretical legitimacy."

Choose the best answer to each question.  Stoicism was founded in 300 BC by the Greek philosopher Zeno and survived into the Roman era until about  AD 300. According to the Stoics, emotions consist of two movements. The first movement is the immediate  feeling and other reactions (e.g., physiological response) that occur when a stimulus or event occurs. For  instance, consider what could have happened if an army general accused Marcus Aurelius of treason in front  of other officers. The first movement for Marcus may have been (internal) surprise and anger in response to  this insult, accompanied perhaps by some involuntary physiological and expressive responses such as face  flushing and a movement of the eyebrows. The second movement is what one does next about the emotion.  Second movement behaviors occur after thinking and are under one\u2019s control. Examples of second  https://bodheeprep.com    CAT 2022 Question Paper (Slot 1)  movements for Marcus might have included a plot to seek revenge, actions signifying deference and  appeasement, or perhaps proceeding as he would have proceeded whether or not this event occurred:  continuing to lead the Romans in a way that Marcus Aurelius believed best benefited them. In the Stoic view,  choosing a reasoned, unemotional response as the second movement is the only appropriate response.  The Stoics believed that to live the good life and be a good person, we need to free ourselves of nearly all  desires such as too much desire for money, power, or sexual gratification. Prior to second movements, we  can consider what is important in life. Money, power, and excessive sexual gratification are not important.  Character, rationality, and kindness are important. The Epicureans, first associated with the Greek  philosopher Epicurus . . . held a similar view, believing that people should enjoy simple pleasures, such as  good conversation, friendship, food, and wine, but not be indulgent in these pursuits and not follow passion  for those things that hold no real value like power and money. As Oatley (2004) states, \u201cthe Epicureans  articulated a view\u2014enjoyment of relationship with friends, of things that are real rather than illusory, simple  rather than artificially inflated, possible rather than vanishingly unlikely\u2014that is certainly relevant today\u201d . . .  In sum, these ancient Greek and Roman philosophers saw emotions, especially strong ones, as potentially  dangerous. They viewed emotions as experiences that needed to be [reined] in and controlled.  As Oatley (2004) points out, the Stoic idea bears some similarity to Buddhism. Buddha, living in India in the  6th century BC, argued for cultivating a certain attitude that decreases the probability of (in Stoic terms)  destructive second movements. Through meditation and the right attitude, one allows emotions to happen  to oneself (it is impossible to prevent this), but one is advised to observe the emotions without necessarily  acting on them; one achieves some distance and decides what has value and what does not have value.  Additionally, the Stoic idea of developing virtue in oneself, of becoming a good person, which the Stoics  believed we could do because we have a touch of the divine, laid the foundation for the three monotheistic  religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam . . . As with Stoicism, tenets of these religions include controlling  our emotions lest we engage in sinful behavior."

The previous UK government had been looking at fast-tracking the approval of cultivated  meat for human consumption.  5. It underscores the potential for new innovation to help reduce the negative impacts of  intensive animal agriculture.    The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  (. . .) There are three other common drivers for carnivore-human attacks, some of which are  more preventable than others. Natural aggression-based conflicts - such as those involving  females protecting their young or animals protecting a food source - can often be avoided as  long as people stay away from those animals and their food.  Carnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. As they become  more reliant on human food they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they become less  avoidant of humans. Losing that instinctive fear response puts them into more situations where  they could get into an altercation with a human, which often results in that bear being put  down by humans. \"A fed bear is a dead bear,\" says Servheen, referring to a common saying  among biologists and conservationists.  Predatory or predation-related attacks are quite rare, only accounting for 17% of attacks in  North America since 1955. They occur when a carnivore views a human as prey and hunts it like  it would any other animal it uses for food. (. . .)  Then there are animal attacks provoked by people taking pictures with them or feeding them in  natural settings such as national parks which often end with animals being euthanised out of  precaution. \"Eventually, that animal becomes habituated to people, and [then] bad things      Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn    happen to the animal. And the folks who initially wanted to make that connection don't  necessarily realise that,\" says Christine Wilkinson, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley,  California, who's been studying coyote-human conflicts.  After conducting countless postmortems on all types of carnivore-human attacks spanning 75  years, Penteriani's team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans reacted differently.  A 2017 study co-authored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around large  carnivores increases the likelihood of an attack  Two of the most common risky behaviours are parents leaving their children to play outside  unattended and walking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of  coyote attacks involve a dog. \"[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased, or  their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they're walking their dog near a den that's marked, and the  coyote wants to escort them away,\" says Wilkinson.  Experts believe climate change also plays a part in the escalation of human-carnivore conflicts,  but the correlation still needs to be ironed out. \"As finite resources become scarcer, carnivores  and people are coming into more frequent contact, which means that more conflict could  occur,\" says Jen Miller, international programme specialist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service.  For example, she says, there was an uptick in lion attacks in western India during a drought  when lions and people were relying on the same water sources.  (. . .) The likelihood of human-carnivore conflicts appears to be higher in areas of low-income  countries dominated by vast rural landscapes and farmland, according to Penteriani's research.  \"There are a lot of working landscapes in the Global South that are really heterogeneous, that  are interspersed with carnivore habitats, forests and savannahs, which creates a lot more  opportunity for these encounters, just statistically,\" says Wilkinson.",

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \n[S]pices were a global commodity centuries before European voyages. There was a complex \nchain of relations, yet consumers had little knowledge of producers and vice versa. Desire for \nspices helped fuel European colonial empires to create political, military and commercial \nnetworks under a single power. \nHistorians know a fair amount about the supply of spices in Europe during the medieval period - \nthe origins, methods of transportation, the prices - but less about demand. Why go to such \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \nextraordinary efforts to procure expensive products from exotic lands? Still, demand was great \nenough to inspire the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama, launching the first \nfateful wave of European colonialism. . . . \nSo, why were spices so highly prized in Europe in the centuries from about 1000 to 1500? One \nwidely disseminated explanation for medieval demand for spices was that they covered the \ntaste of spoiled meat. . . . Medieval purchasers consumed meat much fresher than what the \naverage city-dweller in the developed world of today has at hand. However, refrigeration was \nnot available, and some hot spices have been shown to serve as an anti-bacterial agent. Salting, \nsmoking or drying meat were other means of preservation. Most spices used in cooking began \nas medical ingredients, and throughout the Middle Ages spices were used as both medicines \nand condiments. Above all, medieval recipes involve the combination of medical and culinary \nlore in order to balance food's humeral properties and prevent disease. Most spices were hot \nand dry and so appropriate in sauces to counteract the moist and wet properties supposedly \npossessed by most meat and fish. . . . \nWhere spices came from was known in a vague sense centuries before the voyages of \nColumbus. Just how vague may be judged by looking at medieval world maps . . . To the \nmedieval European imagination, the East was exotic and alluring. Medieval maps often placed \nIndia close to the so-called Earthly Paradise, the Garden of Eden described in the Bible. \nGeographical knowledge has a lot to do with the perceptions of spices' relative scarcity and the \nreasons for their high prices. An example of the varying notions of scarcity is the conflicting \ninformation about how pepper is harvested. As far back as the 7th  century Europeans thought \nthat pepper in India grew on trees \"guarded\" by serpents that would bite and poison anyone \nwho attempted to gather the fruit. The only way to harvest pepper was to burn the trees, which \nwould drive the snakes underground. Of course, this bit of lore would explain the shriveled \nblack peppercorns, but not white, pink or other colors. \nSpices never had the enduring allure or power of gold and silver or the commercial potential of \nnew products such as tobacco, indigo or sugar. But the taste for spices did continue for a while \nbeyond the Middle Ages. As late as the 17th  century, the English and the Dutch were struggling \nfor control of the Spice Islands: Dutch New Amsterdam, or New York, was exchanged by the \nBritish for one of the Moluccan Islands where nutmeg was grown."

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \nThe history of any major technological or industrial advance is inevitably shadowed by a less \npredictable history of unintended consequences and secondary effects - what economists \nsometimes call \"externalities.\" Sometimes those consequences are innocuous ones, or even \nbeneficial. Gutenberg invents the printing press, and literacy rates rise, which causes a \nsignificant part of the reading public to require spectacles for the first time, which creates a \nsurge of investment in lens-making across Europe, which leads to the invention of the telescope \nand the microscope. \nOftentimes the secondary effects seem to belong to an entirely different sphere of society. \nWhen Willis Carrier hit upon the idea of air-conditioning, the technology was primarily intended \nfor industrial use: ensuring cool, dry air for factories that required low-humidity environments. \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \nBut...it touched off one of the largest migrations in the history of the United States, enabling \nthe rise of metropolitan areas like Phoenix and Las Vegas that barely existed when Carrier first \nstarted tinkering with the idea in the early 1900s. \nSometimes the unintended consequence comes about when consumers use an invention in a \nsurprising way. Edison famously thought his phonograph, which he sometimes called \"the \ntalking machine,\" would primarily be used to take dictation....But then later innovators... \ndiscovered a much larger audience willing to pay for musical recordings made on descendants \nof Edison's original invention. In other cases, the original innovation comes into the world \ndisguised as a plaything...the way the animatronic dolls of the mid-1700s inspired Jacquard to \ninvent the first \"programmable\" loom and Charles Babbage to invent the first machine that fit \nthe modern definition of a computer, setting the stage for the revolution in programmable \ntechnology that would transform the 21 st century in countless ways. \nWe live under the gathering storm of modern history's most momentous unintended \nconsequence....carbon-based climate change. Imagine the vast sweep of inventors whose ideas \nstarted the Industrial Revolution, all the entrepreneurs and scientists and hobbyists who had a \nhand in bringing it about. Line up a thousand of them and ask them all what they had been \nhoping to do with their work. Not one would say that their intent had been to deposit enough \ncarbon in the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect that trapped heat at the surface of the \nplanet. And yet here we are. \nEthyl (leaded fuel) and Freon belonged to the same general class of secondary effect \ninnovations whose unintended consequences stem from some kind of waste by-product that \nthey emit. But the potential health threats of Ethyl (unleaded fuel) were visible in the 1920s, \nunlike, say, the long-term effects of atmospheric carbon build up in the early days of the \nIndustrial Revolution... \nIndeed, it is reasonable to see CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) as a forerunner of the kind of threat \nwe will most likely face in the coming decades, as it becomes increasingly possible for \nindividuals or small groups to create new scientific advances - through chemistry or \nbiotechnology or materials science - setting off unintended consequences that reverberate on a \nglobal scale."

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \nThe job of a peer reviewer is thankless. Collectively, academics spend around 70 million hours \nevery year evaluating each other's manuscripts on the behalf of scholarly journals and they \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \nusually receive no monetary compensation and little if any recognition for their effort. Some do \nit as a way to keep abreast with developments in their field; some simply see it as a duty to the \ndiscipline. Either way, academic publishing would likely crumble without them. \nIn recent years, some scientists have begun posting their reviews online, mainly to claim credit \nfor their work. Sites like Publons allow researchers to either share entire referee reports or \nsimply list the journals for whom they've carried out a review.... \nThe rise of Publons suggests that academics are increasingly placing value on the work of peer \nreview and asking others, such as grant funders, to do the same. While that's vital in the \npublish-or-perish culture of academia, there's also immense value in the data underlying peer \nreview. Sharing peer review data could help journals stamp out fraud, inefficiency, and systemic \nbias in academic publishing..... \nPeer review data could also help root out bias. Last year, a study based on peer review data for \nnearly 24,000 submissions to the biomedical journal eLife found that women and \nnonWesterners were vastly underrepresented among peer reviewers. Only around one in every \nfive reviewers was female, and less than two percent of reviewers were based in developing \ncountries.... Openly publishing peer review data could perhaps also help journals address \nanother problem in academic publishing: fraudulent peer reviews. For instance, a minority of \nauthors have been known to use phony email addresses to pose as an outside expert and \nreview their own manuscripts.... \nOpponents of open peer review commonly argue that confidentiality is vital to the integrity of \nthe review process; referees may be less critical of manuscripts if their reports are published, \nespecially if they are revealing their identities by signing them. Some also hold concerns that \nopen reviewing may deter referees from agreeing to judge manuscripts in the first place, or \nthat they'll take longer to do so out of fear of scrutiny.... \nEven when the content of reviews and the identity of reviewers can't be shared publicly, \nperhaps journals could share the data with outside researchers for study. Or they could release \nother figures that wouldn't compromise the anonymity of reviews but that might answer \nimportant questions about how long the reviewing process takes, how many researchers \neditors have to reach out to on average to find one who will carry out the work, and the \ngeographic distribution of peer reviewers. \nOf course, opening up data underlying the reviewing process will not fix peer review entirely, \nand there may be instances in which there are valid reasons to keep the content of peer \nreviews hidden and the identity of the referees confidential. But the norm should shift from \nopacity in all cases to opacity only when necessary."

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \nOftentimes, when economists cross borders, they are less interested in learning from others \nthan in invading their garden plots. Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human \ncapital. To do so, he famously tackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods \nhoned in the study of markets to domains of nonmarket life. He projected economics outward \ninto new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to which humans calculate marginal \nutilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the same time, he did not \nlet other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not borrow from \nanthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo \neconomicus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyday of the discipline's \nbravura. \nTimes have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task, within \nand beyond its ramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and \ncollaborated\u2014been less imperial, more open. Consider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to \nhistorians. The booming field of behavioral economics-the fusion of economics and social \npsychology-is another case. Having spawned active subfields, like judgment, decisionmaking \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \nand a turn to experimentation, the field aims to go beyond the caricature of Rational Man to \nexplain how humans make decisions.... \nIt is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For generations, \neconomists have presumed that people have interests-\"preferences,\" in the neoclassical argot-\nthat get revealed in the course of peoples' choices. Interests come before actions and \ndetermine them. If you are hungry, you buy lunch; if you are cold, you get a sweater. If you only \nhave so much money and can't afford to deal with both your growling stomach and your \nshivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings reveals your preference. \nPsychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly, even \nsome mainstream economists have to admit that homo economicus doesn't always behave like \nthe textbook maximizer; irrational behavior can't simply be waved away as extraeconomic \nexpressions of passions over interests, and thus the domain of other disciplines.... This is one \nplace where the humanist can help the economist. If narrative economics is going to help us \nunderstand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who loses, we are going to need much more \nthan lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial stimuli. \nAbove all, we need politics and institutions. Shiller [the Nobel prize winning economist] \nconnects perceptions of narratives to changes in behavior and thence to social outcomes. He \ncompletes a circle that was key to behavioral economics and brings in storytelling to make \nsense of how perceptions get framed. This cycle (perception to behavior to society) was once \nmediated or dominated by institutions: the political parties, lobby groups, and media \norganizations that played a vital role in legitimating, representing, and excluding interests. Yet \ninstitutions have been stripped from Shiller's account, to reveal a bare dynamic of emotions \nand economics, without the intermediating place of politics."

Certain codes may, of course, be so widely distributed in a specific language community or  culture, and be learned at so early an age, that they appear not to be constructed - the effect of  an articulation between sign and referent - but to be 'naturally' given. Simple visual signs  appear to have achieved a 'near-universality' in this sense: though evidence remains that even  apparently 'natural' visual codes are culture specific. However, this does not mean that no  codes have intervened; rather, that the codes have been profoundly naturalized. The operation  of naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and 'naturalness' of language but the depth,  the habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use. They produce apparently 'natural'  recognitions. This has the (ideological) effect of concealing the practices of coding which are  present.",

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \nIn the summer of 2022, subscribers to the US streaming service HBO MAX were alarmed to \ndiscover that dozens of the platform's offerings - from the Covid-themed heist thriller Locked \nDown to the recent remake of The Witches - had been quietly removed from the service . . . \nThe news seemed like vindication to those who had long warned that streaming was more \nabout controlling access to the cultural commons than expanding it, as did reports (since \ndenied by the show's creators) that Netflix had begun editing old episodes of Stranger Things to \nretroactively improve their visual effects. \nWhat's less clear is whether the commonly prescribed cure for these cultural ills - a return to \nthe material pleasures of physical media - is the right one. While the makers of Blu-ray discs \nclaim they have a shelf life of 100 years, such statistics remain largely theoretical until they \ncome to pass, and are dependent on storage conditions, not to mention the continued \navailability of playback equipment. The humble DVD has already proved far less resilient, with \nmany early releases already beginning to deteriorate in quality Digital movie purchases provide \neven less security. Any film \"bought\" on iTunes could disappear if you move to another territory \nwith a different rights agreement and try to redownload it. It's a bold new frontier in the \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \ncommodification of art: the birth of the product recall. After a man took to Twitter to bemoan \nlosing access to Cars 2 after moving from Canada to Australia, Apple clarified that users who \ndownloaded films to their devices would retain permanent access to those downloads, even if \nthey relocated to a hemisphere where the [content was] subject to a different set of rights \nagreements. Thanks to the company's ironclad digital rights management technology, however, \nsuch files cannot be moved or backed up, locking you into watching with your Apple account. \nAnyone who does manage to acquire Digital Rights Management free (DRM-free) copies of \ntheir favourite films must nonetheless grapple with ever-changing file format standards, not to \nmention data decay - the gradual process by which electronic information slowly but surely \ncorrupts. Only the regular migration of files from hard drive to hard drive can delay the \ninevitable, in a sisyphean battle against the ravages of digital time. \nIn a sense, none of this is new. Charlie Chaplin burned the negative of his 1926 film A Woman of \nthe Sea as a tax write-off. Many more films have been lost through accident, negligence or plain \nindifference. During a heatwave in July 1937, a Fox film vault in New Jersey burned down, \ndestroying a majority of the silent films produced by the studio. \nBack then, at least, cinema was defined by its ephemerality: the sense that a film was as good \nas gone once it left your local cinema. Today, with film studios keen to stress the breadth of \ntheir back catalogues (or to put in Hollywood terms, the value of their IPs), audiences may start \nto wonder why those same studios seem happy to set the vault alight themselves if it'll help \nnext quarter's numbers."

Based on the passage, choose the best \nanswer for each question. \n. . . [T]he idea of craftsmanship is not simply nostalgic. . . . Crafts require distinct skills, an \nallround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an \nattitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The \nconcept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment. \n \n \nOnline CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \n \nEssentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management \nstudies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . . Craft \nskills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist. \nThe contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19th  century when \nBritish manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed \nthe \"American system\" using standardised parts. . . the worldwide success of the Singer sewing \nmachine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own \nreaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19 th century, and then \nagain in the \"small is beautiful\" movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as \npeople become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry. \nThere are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the \nexistence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to \nbe of extra quality. . . . The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their \npurchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to \ncraftspeople to be mended, or recycled. \nFor workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative \nchoices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the \noverall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers \nfocus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite \nthe \"agile\" manifesto in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. \nThe pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \"individuals and \ninteractions over processes and tools\". By bringing together experts from different teams, agile \nworking is designed to improve creativity. \nBut the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. \nDemand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might \nget automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and \nservices often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the \nadvantage. \nHistory also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft \nguilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants. They were also highly hierarchical with \nyoung men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could \nset up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them. \nCraft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don't get too organised."

[1] Demographic transition in America in the twentieth century is strongly marked by an  outmigration from rural areas.

Choose the best answer to  each question.  Interpretations of the Indian past . . . were inevitably influenced by colonial concerns  and interests, and also by prevalent European ideas about history, civilization and the  Orient. Orientalist scholars studied the languages and the texts with selected Indian  scholars, but made little attempt to understand the world-view of those who were  teaching them. The readings therefore are something of a disjuncture from the  traditional ways of looking at the Indian past. . . .  Orientalism [which we can understand broadly as Western perceptions of the Orient]  fuelled the fantasy and the freedom sought by European Romanticism, particularly in its  opposition to the more disciplined Neo-Classicism. The cultures of Asia were seen as  bringing a new Romantic paradigm. Another Renaissance was anticipated through an  acquaintance with the Orient, and this, it was thought, would be different from the  earlier Greek Renaissance. It was believed that this Oriental Renaissance would liberate  European thought and literature from the increasing focus on discipline and rationality      that had followed from the earlier Enlightenment. . . [The Romantic English poets,  Wordsworth and Coleridge,] were apprehensive of the changes introduced by  industrialization and turned to nature and to fantasies of the Orient.  However, this enthusiasm gradually changed, to conform with the emphasis later in the  nineteenth century on the innate superiority of European civilization. Oriental  civilizations were now seen as having once been great but currently in decline. The  various phases of Orientalism tended to mould European understanding of the Indian  past into a particular pattern. . . . There was an attempt to formulate Indian culture as  uniform, such formulations being derived from texts that were given priority. The so- called 'discovery' of India was largely through selected literature in Sanskrit. This  interpretation tended to emphasize nonhistorical aspects of Indian culture, for example  the idea of an unchanging continuity of society and religion over 3,000 years; and it was  believed that the Indian pattern of life was so concerned with metaphysics and the  subtleties of religious belief that little attention was given to the more tangible aspects.  German Romanticism endorsed this image of India, and it became the mystic land for  many Europeans, where even the most ordinary actions were imbued with a complex  symbolism. This was the genesis of the idea of the spiritual east, and also, incidentally,  the refuge of European intellectuals seeking to distance themselves from the changing  patterns of their own societies. A dichotomy in values was maintained, Indian values  being described as 'spiritual' and European values as 'materialistic', with little attempt to  juxtapose these values with the reality of Indian society. This theme has been even  more firmly endorsed by a section of Indian opinion during the last hundred years.  It was a consolation to the Indian intelligentsia for its perceived inability to counter the  technical superiority of the west, a superiority viewed as having enabled Europe to  colonize Asia and other parts of the world. At the height of anti-colonial nationalism it  acted as a salve for having been made a colony of Britain.",

[1] Reading about the life of early American settlers and later waves of migration to  understand the evolution of American culture.  [2] Reading 18th  century accounts by travellers to India to see how they viewed Indian  life and culture of the time.  [3] Studying artefacts excavated at a palace to understand the lifestyle of those who  lived there.  [4] Analysing Hollywood action movies that depict violence and sex to understand  contemporary America.  The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to  each question.  As software improves, the people using it become less likely to sharpen their own know- how. Applications that offer lots of prompts and tips are often to blame; simpler, less  solicitous programs push people harder to think, act and learn.      Ten years ago, information scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands had a  group of people carry out complicated analytical and planning tasks using either  rudimentary software that provided no assistance or sophisticated software that offered  a great deal of aid. The researchers found that the people using the simple software  developed better strategies, made fewer mistakes and developed a deeper aptitude for  the work. The people using the more advanced software, meanwhile, would often  \"aimlessly click around\" when confronted with a tricky problem. The supposedly helpful  software actually short-circuited their thinking and learning.  [According to] philosopher Hubert Dreyfus . . . . our skills get sharper only through  practice, when we use them regularly to overcome different sorts of difficult challenges.  The goal of  modern software, by contrast, is to ease our way through such challenges. Arduous,  painstaking work is exactly what programmers are most eager to automate-after all,  that is where the immediate efficiency gains tend to lie. In other words, a fundamental  tension ripples between the interests of the people doing the automation and the  interests of the people doing the work.  Nevertheless, automation's scope continues to widen. With the rise of electronic health  records, physicians increasingly rely on software templates to guide them through  patient exams. The programs incorporate valuable checklists and alerts, but they also  make medicine more routinized and formulaic\u2014and distance doctors from their  patients . . . Harvard Medical School professor Beth Lown, in a 2012 journal article . . .  warned that when doctors become \"screen-driven,\" following a computer's prompts  rather than \"the patient's narrative thread,\" their thinking can become constricted. In  the worst cases, they may miss important diagnostic signals. . . .  In a recent paper published in the journal Diagnosis, three medical researchers . . .  examined the misdiagnosis of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the  U.S., at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. They argue that the digital templates  used by the hospital's clinicians to record patient information probably helped to induce  a kind of tunnel vision. \"These highly constrained tools,\" the researchers write, \"are  optimized for data capture but at the expense of sacrificing their utility for appropriate  triage and diagnosis, leading users to miss the forest for the trees.\" Medical software,  they write, is no \"replacement for basic history-taking, examination skills, and critical  thinking.\" . . . There is an alternative. In \"human-centered automation,\" the talents of  people take precedence . . . . In this model, software plays an essential but secondary  role. It takes over routine functions that a human operator has already mastered, issues  alerts when unexpected situations arise, provides fresh information that expands the  operator's perspective and counters the biases that often distort human thinking. The  technology becomes the expert's partner, not the expert's replacement.",

    "question_text": "In the context of the passage, all of the following can be considered examples of  humancentered automation EXCEPT:      [1] a smart-home system that changes the temperature as instructed by the resident.  [2] software that offers interpretations when requested by the human operator.  [3] medical software that provides optional feedback on the doctor's analysis of the  medical situation.  [4] software that auto-completes text when the user writes an email.  The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to  each  question.  Nature has all along yielded her flesh to humans. First, we took nature's materials as  food, fibers, and shelter. Then we learned to extract raw materials from her biosphere  to create our own new synthetic materials. Now Bios is yielding us her mind-we are  taking her logic. Clockwork logic-the logic of the machines-will only build simple  contraptions. Truly complex systems such as a cell, a meadow, an economy, or a brain  (natural or artificial) require a rigorous nontechnological logic. We now see that no logic  except bio-logic can assemble a thinking device, or even a workable system of any  magnitude.  It is an astounding discovery that one can extract the logic of Bios out of biology and  have something useful. Although many philosophers in the past have suspected one  could abstract the laws of life and apply them elsewhere, it wasn't until the complexity  of computers and human-made systems became as complicated as living things, that it  was possible to prove this. It's eerie how much of life can be transferred. So far, some of  the traits of the living that have successfully been transported to mechanical systems  are: self-replication, selfgovernance, limited self-repair, mild evolution, and partial  learning.  We have reason to believe yet more can be synthesized and made into something new.  Yet at the same time that the logic of Bios is being imported into machines, the logic of  Technos is being imported into life. The root of bioengineering is the desire to control  the organic long enough to improve it. Domesticated plants and animals are examples of  technos-logic applied to life. The wild aromatic root of the Queen Anne's lace weed has  been fine-tuned over generations by selective herb gatherers until it has evolved into a  sweet carrot of the garden; the udders of wild bovines have been selectively enlarged in  a \"unnatural\" way to satisfy humans rather than calves. Milk cows and carrots,  therefore, are human inventions as much as steam engines and gunpowder are. But  milk cows and carrots are more indicative of the kind of inventions humans will make in  the future: products that are grown rather than manufactured.      Genetic engineering is precisely what cattle breeders do when they select better strains  of Holsteins, only bioengineers employ more precise and powerful control. While carrot  and milk cow breeders had to rely on diffuse organic evolution, modern genetic  engineers can use  directed artificial evolution-purposeful design\u2014which greatly accelerates  improvements. The overlap of the mechanical and the lifelike increases year by year.  Part of this bionic convergence is a matter of words. The meanings of \"mechanical\" and  \"life\" are both stretching until all complicated things can be perceived as machines, and  all self-sustaining machines can be perceived as alive. Yet beyond semantics, two  concrete trends are happening: (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and  (2) Life is becoming more engineered. The apparent veil between the organic and the  manufactured has crumpled to reveal that the two really are, and have always been, of  one being.  Which one of the following sets of words/phrases best serves as keywords to the  passage?  [1] Complex systems; Bio-logic; Bioengineering; Technos-logic; Convergence  [2] Nature; Bios; Technos; Self-repair; Holsteins  [3] Nature; Computers; Carrots; Milk cows; Genetic engineering  [4] Complex systems; Carrots; Milk cows; Convergence; Technos-logic  None of the following statements is implied by the arguments of the passage, EXCEPT:  [1] purposeful design represents the pinnacle of scientific expertise in the service of  human betterment and civilisational progress.  [2] the biological realm is as complex as the mechanical one; which is why the logic of  Bios is being imported into machines.  [3] historically, philosophers have known that the laws of life can be abstracted and  applied elsewhere.  [4] genetic engineers and bioengineers are the same insofar as they both seek to force  evolution in an artificial way.",

To defend the sequence of alphabetisation may seem bizarre, so obvious is its  application  that it is hard to imagine a reference, catalogue or listing without it. But alphabetical  order was not an immediate consequence of the alphabet itself. In the Middle Ages,  deference for ecclesiastical tradition left scholars reluctant to categorise things  according to the alphabet to do so would be a rejection of the divine order. The  rediscovery of the ancient Greek and Roman classics necessitated more efficient ways of  ordering, searching and referencing texts. Government bureaucracy in the 16th and  17th centuries quickened the advance of alphabetical order, bringing with it  pigeonholes, notebooks and card indexes.  [1] The alphabetic order took several centuries to gain common currency because of  religious beliefs and a lack of appreciation of its efficacy in the ordering of things.  [2] Unlike the alphabet, once the efficacy of the alphabetic sequence became apparent  to scholars and administrators, its use became widespread.  [3] The ban on the use by scholars of any form of categorisation - but the divinely  ordained one - delayed the adoption of the alphabetic sequence by several centuries.

[1] Thinking beyond qualifications allows us to give free reign to musical expressions.  [2] A bald statement is one that is trailed by a series of qualifying clarifications and  caveats.  [3] Although there may be many caveats and other considerations, the statement is  essentially true.  [4] A bald statement is one that requires no qualifications to infer its meaning.  The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to  each question.  [Octopuses are] misfits in their own extended families ... They belong to the Mollusca  class Cephalopoda. But they don't look like their cousins at all. Other molluscs include  sea snails, sea slugs, bivalves - most are shelled invertebrates with a dorsal foot.  Cephalopods are all arms, and can be as tiny as 1 centimetre and as large at 30 feet.  Some of them have brains the size of a walnut, which is large for an invertebrate. . . .  It makes sense for these molluscs to have added protection in the form of a higher  cognition; they don't have a shell covering them, and pretty much everything feeds on  cephalopods, including humans. But how did cephalopods manage to secure their own  invisibility cloak?  Cephalopods fire from multiple cylinders to achieve this in varying degrees from species  to species. There are four main catalysts - chromatophores, iridophores, papillae and  leucophores....  [Chromatophores] are organs on their bodies that contain pigment sacs, which have red,  yellow and brown pigment granules. These sacs have a network of radial muscles,  meaning muscles arranged in a circle radiating outwards. These are connected to the  brain by a nerve. When the cephalopod wants to change colour, the brain carries an  electrical impulse through the nerve to the muscles that expand outwards, pulling open  the sacs to display the colours on the skin. Why these three colours? Because these are  the colours the light reflects at the depths they live in (the rest is absorbed before it  reaches those depths). . . . Well, what about other colours? Cue the iridophores. Think  of a second level of skin that has thin stacks of cells. These can reflect light back at  different wavelengths. . . It's using the same properties that we've seen in hologram  stickers, or rainbows on puddles of oil. You move your head and you see a different  colour. The sticker isn't doing anything but reflecting light - it's your movement that's  changing the appearance of the colour. This property of holograms, oil and other such  surfaces is called \"iridescence\". . . .  Papillae are sections of the skin that can be deformed to make a texture bumpy. Even  humans possess them (goosebumps) but cannot use them in the manner that  cephalopods can. For instance, the use of these cells is how an octopus can wrap itself      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    over a rock and appear jagged or how a squid or cuttlefish can imitate the look of a coral  reef by growing miniature towers on its skin. It actually matches the texture of the  substrate it chooses. Finally, the leucophores: According to a paper, published in Nature,  cuttlefish and octopuses possess an additional type of reflector cell called a leucophore.  They are cells that scatter full spectrum light so that they appear white in a similar way  that a polar bear's fur appears white. Leucophores will also reflect any filtered light  shown on them . . If the water appears blue at a certain depth, the octopuses and  cuttlefish can appear blue; if the water appears green, they appear green, and so on and  so forth.",

Choose the best answer to  each https://bodheeprep.com/  We begin with the emergence of the philosophy of the social sciences as an arena of  thought and as a set of social institutions. The two characterisations overlap but are not  congruent. Academic disciplines are social institutions. . . My view is that institutions are  all those social entities that organise action: they link acting individuals into social  structures. There are various kinds of institutions. Hegelians and Marxists emphasise  universal institutions such as the family, rituals, governance, economy and the military.  These are mostly institutions that just grew. Perhaps in some imaginary beginning of  time they spontaneously appeared. In their present incarnations, however, they are  very much the product of conscious attempts to mould and plan them. We have family  law, established and disestablished churches, constitutions and laws, including those  governing the economy and the military. Institutions deriving from statute, like joint- stock companies are formal by contrast with informal ones such as friendships. There  are some institutions that come in both informal and formal variants, as well as in mixed  ones. Consider the fact that the stock exchange and the black market are both market  institutions, one formal one not. Consider further that there are many features of the  work of the stock exchange that rely on informal, noncodifiable agreements, not least  the language used for communication. To be precise, mixtures are the norm . . . From  constitutions at the top to by-laws near the bottom we are always adding to, or  tinkering with, earlier institutions, the grown and the designed are intertwined. It is  usual in social thought to treat culture and tradition as different from, although  alongside, institutions. The view taken here is different. Culture and tradition are sub- sets of institutions analytically isolated for explanatory or expository purposes. Some  social scientists have taken all institutions, even purely local ones, to be entities that  satisfy basic human needs - under local conditions . . . Others differed and declared any  structure of reciprocal roles and norms an institution. Most of these differences are  differences of emphasis rather than disagreements. Let us straddle all these versions  and present institutions very generally . . . as structures that serve to coordinate the  actions of individuals. . . . Institutions themselves then have no aims or purpose other  than those given to them by actors or used by actors to explain them . . .  Language is the formative institution for social life and for science . . . Both formal and  informal language is involved, naturally grown or designed. (Language is all of these to  varying degrees.) Languages are paradigms of institutions or, from another perspective,      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    nested sets of institutions. Syntax, semantics, lexicon and alphabet/character-set are all  institutions within the larger institutional framework of a written language. Natural  languages are typical examples of what Ferguson called 'the result of human action, but  not the execution of any human design'[;] reformed natural languages and artificial  languages introduce design into their modifications or refinements of natural language.  Above all, languages are paradigms of institutional tools that function to coordinate.",

The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to  each question.  When we teach engineering problems now, we ask students to come to a single \"best\"  solution defined by technical ideals like low cost, speed to build, and ability to scale. This  way of teaching primes students to believe that their decision-making is purely  objective, as it is grounded in math and science. This is known as technical-social  dualism, the idea that the technical and social dimensions of engineering problems are  readily separable and remain distinct throughout the problem-definition and solution  process.  Nontechnical parameters such as access to a technology, cultural relevancy or potential  harms are deemed political and invalid in this way of learning. But those technical ideals  are at their core social and political choices determined by a dominant culture focused  on economic growth for the most privileged segments of society. By choosing to  downplay public welfare as a critical parameter for engineering design, we risk creating  a culture of disengagement from societal concerns amongst engineers that is  antithetical to the ethical code of engineering.  In my field of medical devices, ignoring social dimensions has real consequences. . . .  Most FDA-approved drugs are incorrectly dosed for people assigned female at birth,  leading to unexpected adverse reactions. This is because they have been inadequately  represented in  Beyond physical failings, subjective beliefs treated as facts by those in decision-making  roles can encode social inequities. For example, spirometers, routinely used devices that  measure lung capacity, still have correction factors that automatically assume smaller  lung capacity in Black and Asian individuals. These racially based adjustments are  derived from research done by eugenicists who thought these racial differences were  biologically determined and who considered nonwhite people as inferior. These  machines ignore the influence of social and environmental factors on lung capacity.  Many technologies for systemically marginalized people have not been built because  they were not deemed important such as better early diagnostics and treatment for  diseases like endometriosis, a disease that afflicts 10 percent of people with uteruses.  And we hardly question whether devices are built sustainably, which has led to a crisis  of medical waste and health care accounting for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas  emissions.      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    Social justice must be made core to the way engineers are trained. Some universities are  working on this. . . . Engineers taught this way will be prepared to think critically about  what problems we choose to solve, how we do so responsibly and how we build teams  that challenge our ways of thinking.  Individual engineering professors are also working to embed societal needs in their  pedagogy. Darshan Karwat at the University of Arizona developed activist engineering to  challenge engineers to acknowledge their full moral and social responsibility through  practical selfreflection. Khalid Kadir at the University of California, Berkeley, created the  popular course Engineering, Environment, and Society that teaches engineers how to  engage in place-based knowledge, an understanding of the people, context and history,  to design better technical approaches in collaboration with communities. When we  design and build with equity and justice in mind, we craft better solutions that respond  to the complexities of entrenched systemic problems.",

Today, many of the debates about behavioural control in the age of big data echo Cold  Warera anxieties about brainwashing, insidious manipulation and repression in the  'technological society'. In his book Psychopolitics, Han warns of the sophisticated use of  targeted online content, enabling 'influence to take place on a pre-reflexive level'. On  our current trajectory, \"freedom will prove to have been merely an interlude.\" The fear  is that the digital age has not liberated us but exposed us, by offering up our private  lives to machine-learning algorithms that can process masses of personal and  behavioural data. In a world of influencers and digital entrepreneurs, it's not easy to  imagine the resurgence of a culture engendered through disconnect and disaffiliation,  but concerns over the threat of online targeting, polarisation and big data have inspired  recent polemics about the need to rediscover solitude and disconnect.  [1] The role of technology in influencing public behaviour is reminiscent of the manner  in which behaviour was manipulated during the Cold War.      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    [2] With big data making personal information freely available, the debate on the nature  of freedom and the need for privacy has resurfaced.  [3] The notion of freedom and privacy is at stake in a world where artificial intelligence  is  capable of influencing behaviour through data gathered online.  [4] Rather than freeing us, digital technology is enslaving us by collecting personal  information and influencing our online behaviour.

Decide on the proper sequencing of the order of the sentences  and key in the sequence of the four numbers as your answer:  [1] The trajectory of cheerfulness through the self is linked to the history of the word  'cheer' which comes from an Old French meaning 'face'.  [2] Translations of the Bible into vernacular languages, expanded the noun 'cheer' into  the more abstract 'cheerful-ness', something that circulates as an emotional and social  quality defining the self and a moral community.  [3] When you take on a cheerful expression, no matter what the state of your soul, your  cheerfulness moves into the self: the interior of the self is changed by the power of  cheer.  [4] People in the medieval 'Canterbury Tales' have a 'piteous' or a 'sober' cheer; 'cheer'  is an expression and a body part, lying at the intersection of emotions and physiognomy.",

There's a common idea that museum artworks are somehow timeless objects available  to admire for generations to come. But many are objects of decay. Even the most  venerable Old Master paintings don't escape: pigments discolour, varnishes crack,  canvases warp. This challenging fact of art-world life is down to something that sounds  more like a thread from a morality tale: inherent vice. Damien Hirst's iconic shark  floating in a tank - entitled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone  Living - is a work that put a spotlight on inherent vice. When he made it in 1991, Hirst  got himself in a pickle by not using the right kind of pickle to preserve the giant fish. The  result was that the shark began to decompose quite quickly - its preserving liquid  clouding, the skin wrinkling, and an unpleasant smell wafting from the tank.

Several of the world's earliest cities were organised along egalitarian lines.

Far from  resigning us to inequality, the picture that is now emerging of humanity's past may open  our eyes to egalitarian possibilities we otherwise would have never considered.  [1] We now have the evidence in support of the existence of an egalitarian urban life in  some ancient cities, where political and civic organisation was far less hierarchical.

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  Many human phenomena and characteristics - such as behaviors, beliefs, economies, genes,  incomes, life expectancies, and other things - are influenced both by geographic factors and by  non-geographic factors. Geographic factors mean physical and biological factors tied to  geographic location, including climate, the distributions of wild plant and animal species, soils,  and topography. Non-geographic factors include those factors subsumed under the term  culture, other factors subsumed under the term history, and decisions by individual people....  [T]he differences between the current economies of North and South Korea ... cannot be  attributed to the modest environmental differences between [them] ... They are instead due  entirely to the different [government] policies ... At the opposite extreme, the Inuit and other  traditional peoples living north of the Arctic Circle developed warm fur clothes but no  agriculture, while equatorial lowland peoples around the world never developed warm fur  clothes but often did develop agriculture. The explanation is straightforwardly geographic,  rather than a cultural or historical quirk unrelated to geography. . . Aboriginal Australia  remained the sole continent occupied only by hunter/gatherers and with no indigenous farming  or herding ... [Here the] explanation is biogeographic: the Australian continent has no  domesticable native animal species and few domesticable native plant species. Instead, the  crops and domestic animals that now make Australia a food and wool exporter are all non- native (mainly Eurasian) species such as sheep, wheat, and grapes, brought to Australia by  overseas colonists.  Today, no scholar would be silly enough to deny that culture, history, and individual choices  play a big role in many human phenomena. Scholars don't react to cultural, historical, and  individual-agent explanations by denouncing \"cultural determinism,\" \"historical determinism,\"  or \"individual determinism,\" and then thinking no further. But many scholars do react to any  explanation invoking some geographic role, by denouncing \"geographic determinism\" ...    4  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  Several reasons may underlie this widespread but nonsensical view. One reason is that some  geographic explanations advanced a century ago were racist, thereby causing all geographic  explanations to become tainted by racist associations in the minds of many scholars other than  geographers. But many genetic, historical, psychological, and anthropological explanations  advanced a century ago were also racist, yet the validity of newer non-racist genetic etc.  explanations is widely accepted today.  Another reason for reflex rejection of geographic explanations is that historians have a  tradition, in their discipline, of stressing the role of contingency (a favorite word among  historians) based on individual decisions and chance. Often that view is warranted . . . But  often, too, that view is unwarranted. The development of warm fur clothes among the Inuit  living north of the Arctic Circle was not because one influential Inuit leader persuaded other  Inuit in 1783 to adopt warm fur clothes, for no good environmental reason.  A third reason is that geographic explanations usually depend on detailed technical facts of  geography and other fields of scholarship ... Most historians and economists don't acquire that  detailed knowledge as part of the professional training."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  [Fifty] years after its publication in English [in 1972], and just a year since [Marshall] Sahlins  himself died\u2014we may ask: why did [his essay] \"Original Affluent Society\" have such an impact,  and how has it fared since? ... Sahlins's principal argument was simple but counterintuitive:  before being driven into marginal environments by colonial powers, huntergatherers, or  foragers, were not engaged in a desperate struggle for meager survival. Quite the contrary,  they satisfied their needs with far less work than people in agricultural and industrial societies,  leaving them more time to use as they wished. Hunters, he quipped, keep bankers' hours.  Refusing to maximize, many were \"more concerned with games of chance than with chances of  game.\" . . . The so-called Neolithic Revolution, rather than improving life, imposed a harsher  work regime and set in motion the long history of growing inequality ...  Moreover, foragers had other options. The contemporary Hadza of Tanzania, who had long  been surrounded by farmers, knew they had alternatives and rejected them. To Sahlins, this  showed that foragers are not simply examples of human diversity or victimhood but something  more profound: they demonstrated that societies make real choices. Culture, a way of living  oriented around a distinctive set of values, manifests a fundamental principle of collective self- determination. . .  But the point [of the essay] is not so much the empirical validity of the data-the real interest for  most readers, after all, is not in foragers either today or in the Paleolithic-but rather its  conceptual challenge to contemporary economic life and bourgeois individualism. The empirical    6  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  served a philosophical and political project, a thought experiment and stimulus to the  imagination of possibilities.  With its title's nod toward The Affluent Society (1958), economist John Kenneth Galbraith's  famously skeptical portrait of America's postwar prosperity and inequality, and dripping with  New Left contempt for consumerism, \"The Original Affluent Society\" brought this critical  perspective to bear on the contemporary world. It did so through the classic anthropological  move of showing that radical alternatives to the readers' lives really exist. If the capitalist world  seeks wealth through ever greater material production to meet infinitely expansive desires,  foraging societies follow \"the Zen road to affluence\": not by getting more, but by wanting less.  If it seems that foragers have been left behind by \"progress,\" this is due only to the  ethnocentric self-congratulation of the West. Rather than accumulate material goods, these  societies are guided by other values: leisure, mobility, and above all, freedom. . .  Viewed in today's context, of course, not every aspect of the essay has aged well. While  acknowledging the violence of colonialism, racism, and dispossession, it does not thematize  them as heavily as we might today. Rebuking evolutionary anthropologists for treating present- day foragers as \"left behind\" by progress, it too can succumb to the temptation to use them as  proxies for the Paleolithic. Yet these characteristics should not distract us from appreciating  Sahlins's effort to show that if we want to conjure new possibilities, we need to learn about  actually inhabitable worlds."

Based on the passage, choose the best  answer for each question.  RESIDENTS of Loz\u00e8re, a hilly department in southern France, recite complaints familiar to many  rural corners of Europe. In remote hamlets and villages, with names such as Le Bacon and Le  Bacon Vieux, mayors grumble about a lack of local schools, jobs, or phone and internet  connections. Farmers of grazing animals add another concern: the return of wolves. Eradicated  from France last century, the predators are gradually creeping back to more forests and  hillsides. \"The wolf must be taken in hand,\" said an aspiring parliamentarian, Francis Palombi,  when pressed by voters in an election campaign early this summer. Tourists enjoy visiting a  wolf park in Loz\u00e8re, but farmers fret over their livestock and their livelihoods.  As early as the ninth century, the royal office of the Luparii-wolf-catchers-was created in France  to tackle the predators. Those official hunters (and others) completed their job in the 1930s,  when the last wolf disappeared from the mainland. Active hunting and improved technology  such as rifles in the 19th century, plus the use of poison such as strychnine later on, caused the    8  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  population collapse. But in the early 1990s the animals reappeared. They crossed the Alps from  Italy, upsetting sheep farmers on the French side of the border. Wolves have since spread to  areas such as Loz\u00e8re, delighting environmentalists, who see the predators' presence as a sign of  wider ecological health. Farmers, who say the wolves cause the deaths of thousands of sheep  and other grazing animals, are less cheerful. They grumble that green activists and politically  correct urban types have allowed the return of an old enemy.  Various factors explain the changes of the past few decades. Rural depopulation is part of the  story. In Loz\u00e8re, for example, farming and a once-flourishing mining industry supported a  population of over 140,000 residents in the mid- 19th century. Today the department has fewer  than 80,000 people, many in its towns. As humans withdraw, forests are expanding. In France,  between 1990 and 2015, forest cover increased by an average of 102,000 hectares each year,  as more fields were given over to trees. Now, nearly one-third of mainland France is covered by  woodland of some sort. The decline of hunting as a sport also means more forests fall quiet. In  the mid-to-late 20th century over 2m hunters regularly spent winter weekends tramping in  woodland, seeking boars, birds and other prey. Today the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Chasseurs,  the national body, claims 1.1 m people hold hunting licences, though the number of active  hunters is probably lower. The mostly protected status of the wolf in Europe-hunting them is  now forbidden, other than when occasional culls are sanctioned by the state-plus the efforts of  NGOs to track and count the animals, also contribute to the recovery of wolf populations.  As the lupine population of Europe spreads westwards, with occasional reports of wolves seen  closer to urban areas, expect to hear of more clashes between farmers and those who  celebrate the predators' return. Farmers' losses are real, but are not the only economic story.  Tourist venues, such as parks where wolves are kept and the animals' spread is discussed, also  generate income and jobs in rural areas."
