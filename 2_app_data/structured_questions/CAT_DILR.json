[1] 4      [2] 5  [3] 2  [4] 3  Pulak, Qasim, Ritesh, and Suresh participated in a tournament comprising of eight  rounds. In each round, they formed two pairs, with each of them being in exactly one  pair. The only restriction in the pairing was that the pairs would change in successive  rounds. For example, if Pulak formed a pair with Qasim in the first round, then he would  have to form a pair with Ritesh or Suresh in the second round. He would be free to pair  with Qasim again in the third round. In each round, each pair decided whether to play  the game in that round or not. If they decided not to play, then no money was  exchanged between them. If they decided to play, they had to bet either \u20b91 or \u20b92 in that  round. For example, if they chose to bet \u20b92, then  the player winning the game got \u20b92 from the one losing the game.  At the beginning of the tournament, the players had \u20b910 each. The following table  shows partial information about the amounts that the players had at the end of each of  the eight rounds. It shows every time a player had \u20b910 at the end of a round, as well as  every time, at the end of a round, a player had either the minimum or the maximum  amount that he would have had across the eight rounds. For example, Suresh had \u20b910  at the end of Rounds 1, 3, and 8 and not after any of the other rounds. The maximum  amount that he had at the end of any round was \u20b913 (at the end of Round 5), and the  minimum amount he had at the end of any round was \u20b98 (at the end of Round 2). At the  end of all other rounds, he must have had either \u20b99, \u20b911, or \u20b912.  It was also known that Pulak and Qasim had the same amount of money with them at  the end of Round 4.

On each day, a salesman is assigned to visit one housing  complex. Once a salesman enters a housing complex, he can meet any number of  households in the time available. However, if a household makes a complaint against  the salesman, then he must leave the housing complex immediately and cannot meet  any other household on that day. A household may buy any number of TRICCEK items or  may not buy any item. The salesman needs to record the total number of TRICCEK items  sold as well as the number of households met in each day. The success rate of a  salesman for a day is defined as the ratio of the number of items sold to the number of  households met on that day. Some details about the performances of three salesmen -  Tohri, Hokli and Lahur, on two particular days are given below.  1.

Every day a widget supplier supplies widgets from the warehouse (W) to four locations  Ahmednagar (A), Bikrampore (B), Chitrachak (C), and Deccan Park (D). The daily demand  for widgets in each location is uncertain and independent of each other. Demands and  corresponding probability values (in parenthesis) are given against each location (A, B, C,  and D) in the figure below. For example, there is a 40%  chance that the demand in  Ahmednagar will be 50 units and a 60% chance that the demand will be 70 units. The  lines in the figure connecting the locations and warehouse represent two-way roads  connecting those places with the distances (in km) shown beside the line. The distances      https://online.bodheeprep.com/learn    in both the directions along a road are equal. For example, the road from Ahmednagar  to Bikrampore and the road from Bikrampore to Ahmednagar are both 6 km long.    Every day the supplier gets the information about the demand values of the four  locations and creates the travel route that starts from the warehouse and ends at a  location after visiting all the locations exactly once. While making the route plan, the  supplier goes to the locations in decreasing order of demand. If there is a tie for the  choice of the next location, the supplier will go to the location closest to the current  location. Also, while creating the route, the supplier can either follow the direct path (if  available) from one location to another or can take the path via the warehouse. If both  paths are available (direct and via warehouse), the supplier will choose the path with  minimum distance.

      "Only statement B    The schematic diagram below shows 12 rectangular houses in a housing complex. House  numbers are mentioned in the rectangles representing the houses. The houses are located in  six columns - Column-A through Column-F, and two rows - Row-1 and Row- 2 . The houses are  divided into two blocks - Block XX and Block YY. The diagram also shows two roads, one passing  in front of the houses in Row-2 and another between the two blocks.      16  https://online.bodheeprep.com    CAT 2023 QUESTION PAPER WITH ANSWER KEYS (SLOT 01)  Some of the houses are occupied. The remaining ones are vacant and are the only ones  available for sale.   The road adjacency value of a house is the number of its sides adjacent to a road. For example,  the road adjacency values of C2, F2, and B1 are 2, 1, and 0, respectively. The neighbour count of  a house is the number of sides of that house adjacent to occupied houses in the same block. For  example, E1 and C1 can have the maximum possible neighbour counts of 3 and 2, respectively.   The base price of a vacant house is Rs. 10 lakhs if the house does not have a parking space, and  Rs. 12 lakhs if it does. The quoted price (in lakhs of Rs.) of a vacant house is calculated as (base  price) + 5 \u00d7 (road adjacency value) + 3 \u00d7 (neighbour count).   The following information is also known.  1. The maximum quoted price of a house in Block XX is Rs. 24 lakhs. The minimum  quoted price of a house in block YY is Rs. 15 lakhs, and one such house is in Column- E.   2. Row-1 has two occupied houses, one in each block.  3. Both houses in Column-E are vacant. Each of Column-D and Column-F has at least  one occupied house.  4. There is only one house with parking space in Block YY."

      "F1  A visa processing office (VPO) accepts visa applications in four categories - US, UK, Schengen,  and Others. The applications are scheduled for processing in twenty 15-minute slots starting at  9:00 am and ending at 2:00 pm. Ten applications are scheduled in each slot.  There are ten counters in the office, four dedicated to US applications, and two each for UK  applications, Schengen applications and Others applications. Applicants are called in for  processing sequentially on a first-come-first-served basis whenever a counter gets freed for  their category. The processing time for an application is the same within each category. But it  may vary across the categories. Each US and UK application requires 10 minutes of processing  time. Depending on the number of applications in a category and time required to process an  application for that category, it is possible that an applicant for a slot may be processed later.  On a particular day, Ira, Vijay and Nandini were scheduled for Schengen visa processing in that  order. They had a 9:15 am slot but entered the VPO at 9:20 am. When they entered the office,  exactly six out of the ten counters were either processing applications, or had finished  processing one and ready to start processing the next.  Mahira and Osman were scheduled in the 9:30 am slot on that day for visa processing in the  Others category.  The following additional information is known about that day.  1. All slots were full.  2. The number of US applications was the same in all the slots. The same was true for the  other three categories.  3. 50% of the applications were US applications.  4. All applicants except Ira, Vijay and Nandini arrived on time.  5. Vijay was called to a counter at 9:25 am."
